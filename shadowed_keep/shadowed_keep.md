<span id="page-3-0"></span>*Hidden deep in the borderland forest, bandits lurk in the ruined castle of a long-dead border lord. Their incessant raids draw a band of neophyte heroes to the derelict keep. There they discover fouler, more odious dangers lurk below the ruins. Dare you brave the terrors of the Shadowed Keep to crush that which lurks within, or will darkness shroud the surrounding lands?* 

*Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands is an adventure for 1st-level characters compatible with the 5th edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game. Although designed for the Duchy of Ashlar campaign setting, the adventure can be easily inserted into a GM's home campaign.*

*Through encroaching trees brave souls creep, To the walls of the Ironwolf's tumbling keep, Much blood has been spilled o'er this hidden fortress, Whose once-fine halls echo with death's caress.* 

*They say tormented souls still haunt the place, Hearts to be broken by a child's tear-stained face, And amid the debris, all things rotten and old, Lost treasures await the brave and the bold.* 

*But what factions and powers now hold sway, When the ruin's great lord has had his day? What sneaking evil guards the stout tower? And what makes the donjon's prisoners cower?* 

*They tell of a struggle day and night, The Blood Moon are rising, growing their might, But cutthroats and bandits yet hold their ground, Against a tribe skulking beneath the ground.* 

*Could the donjon yield up its secrets to your clever band? Or will its dangers and villains prompt their final stand? And could the keys to a lost kingdom soon be at hand, 'Neath the Shadowed Keep On The Borderland..?*

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>F OREWORD

*Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands* is my love letter to the adventures of my youth—chiefly *Keep on the Borderlands* and the *Village of Hommlet,* both by Gary Gygax. No doubt, if you are a gamer of a "certain age" (or perhaps even older), you'll recognise old-school themes and design choices in the ensuing pages. You might even spot some Easter eggs, as well. If you do, I hope they bring a smile to your face.

![](_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg)

The first edition of *Shadowed Keep on the Borderland* was released in 2012 for Pathfinder 1st edition. Since then, I've learnt a ton about adventure design and publishing and have played many different games and editions involving dungeons and sometimes dragons.

Frankly, I'm surprised revising the adventure took me this long. But it's not just me. The adventure is festooned—even laden—with gorgeous new maps by mapping supremo Tommi Salama and epic new artwork by artist extraordinaire Matt Morrow. I love both their styles—the adventure is far better for their contributions.

Since I wrote the original version of this adventure, I've run it for multiple groups. Every game has been different, and I have many fond memories of the keep (particularly of Goblin "Stabby Stabby" Yar) and one group's "cunning" (and ill-advised) plan to use the gelatinous cube in location M6 as a crash mat. I hope your exploration of the Shadowed Keep spawns similar happy memories for you and your group.

#### EARLY 2025 EDITION

For the foreseeable future, this edition will be the last version of the adventure. I've had tremendous fun incrementally growing this classic adventure (which gas given me an excuse to run it again with a newish group of chums), but all good things must end.

Rather marvellously, releasing the adventure's final edition presents two epic opportunities:

- I can release an adventure hardback (something we've never done before).
- I can start thinking about *Return to the Shadowed Keep*. I love returning to old adventure sites in my campaigns; doing so provides a sense of a living, breathing world and roots the characters in the ongoing story and development of the region. It also allows them to explore the site again at a higher level and (perhaps) a new perspective and quest.

So, while this is an ending, it is also a beginning! I like that duality, and I cannot wait to start designing *Return to the Shadowed Keep*. I already have (dastardly) plans, and let's just say that the direction and theme of this adventure heavily features shadows...perhaps shadows not of this world!

#### THANK YO U

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>RUNNING SHADOWED KEEP

*Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands* is designed for a group of 1st-level characters. The adventure is set in the Duchy of Ashlar, which is part of the Gloamhold campaign setting but can easily be inserted into your own campaign world. The keep's location—a bluff surrounded by dense woodland—is generic enough to fit any but the most atypical campaign. Similarly, the one-time ruler of the fortress is nothing but an adventurer made good and not the scion of some noble house.

This edition of the adventure also includes an ancillary adventure site—the Shunned Valley of the Three Tombs suitable for starting characters. The characters can explore this new locale or completely ignore it as you (and they) see fit.

The *Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands* is a sandbox adventure—the characters can explore the various zones of the keep in almost any order. Thus, the characters will find some areas easier than others, and they may never even discover other portions of the complex (particularly locations D14 – D16).

Similarly, there is no time pressure d u r i n g this adventure—the characters can explore the Shadowed Keep at their leisure. If you would rather a fasterpaced adventure, consider placing a rival group of (black-hearted) adventurers in the area also intent on exploring the ruins. This gives the characters an impetus to explore swiftly and potentially sets up a climactic fight with the rival adventurers somewhere in the ruins!

Once the party has cleared the keep, the characters can move on to their next adventure, or they can claim the fortress as their own. In this way, the keep can become the focus of an entire campaign as the characters battle to clear the surrounding woodland of enemies (or explore the deeper caverns below the keep) while repairing the shattered fortress. The obstacles t o s u c c e s s f u l l y completing such a task are

l e g i o n . ( R e f e r t o " F u r t h e r Adventures" for more details.)

Characters completely exploring the keep and defeating all its challenges should reach 4th-level by the end of the adventure.

#### CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

Although *Shadowed Keep on the Borderland* is a sandbox adventure, various parts of the dungeon are designed for different level characters:

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>ADVENTURE BACKGROUND

Forty years ago, the famed adventurer Valentin Ironwolf sought a place to make his home. Retirement was not in Valentin's heart, but the wanderlust of his youth had long since died; he now sought a corner of the world to call his own. Along with his wife, Kaarina, his young son, Einar, and his faithful retainers,

he claimed the site upon which now stands the Shadowed Keep.

For the next five years, he built his home, slowly turning it into a strongly fortified position from which to d o m i n a t e t h e s u r r o u n d i n g woodlands. As his builders and masons laboured to build his fortress, Valentin and his wife s a l l i e d f o r t h i n t o t h e surrounding forest. Carrying sword and spell against the w a r r i n g h u m a n o i d s t h a t incessantly fought over the place, they strove to push back the savage humanoids. So successful were the pair that they

of the Blood Moon in battle. However, looting the corpses of the fallen failed to provide enough coin for Valentin's needs. As the fighting wore on Valentin discovered he lacked the funds to both finish his home and to crush the last of his enemies. With work stalled on his fortress, Valentin sunk into a great depression and began to drink heavily. Slowly many of his servants and retainers drifted away until only his most loyal followers remained. By then, Valentin lacked the will or might to continue campaigning against his enemies. His enemies, however, had not forgotten the woes he had visited

upon them, and slowly they gathered their strength and waited. Entering into a short but ultimately bloody pact, the Goblins of the Blood Moon and the Orcs of the Severed Hand united to destroy

On a moonless night, when Valentin sat deep in his cups surrounded by his dwindling band of retainers, goblin scouts scaled the keep's once well-guarded walls. Soundlessly slaying Valentin's few remaining guards, they opened the gates to admit the Severed Hand's blood-crazed berserkers. Bloody slaughter engulfed the keep. Surprised and hopelessly outnumbered, most of the defenders died before they realised their enemies were within the walls. A few gathered in the Great Hall about their liege to make their final stand, but once the tide of violence receded, all lay stark amid the blood and gore of Valentin's shattered dream.

With their mutual enemy slain, the orcs and goblins swiftly fell to arguing among themselves. Violence quickly (and inevitably) ensued. Where man had struggled against goblin and orc, now goblin fought orc. When this new fresh wave of violence subsided, the Goblins of the Blood Moon stood triumphant over the hacked and bloody corpses of their enemies. But the goblins' victory was a hollow one; with most of their warriors slain, their power in the region was broken. Hounded by other enemies a few months later, the Blood Moon's survivors retreated to the now-ruined keep to hide and rebuild their shattered strength.

Abandoned by humanity, Ironwolf Keep has thus

Now and then, adventurers came to poke about the ruins in search of lost treasures. Most did not return, and the keep gained a sinister aspect. Named now variously as the Shadowed Keep or Valentin's Folly, only the old and learned still refer to the ruin as Ironwolf Keep.

In the last six months or so, an increase in raids on those using the nearby roads and woodland trails has begun to affect trade between the nearby villages and towns. Folk mutter about something terrible claiming the ruins, while others blame bandits. Whatever the truth of the matter, the locals

# <span id="page-12-0"></span>GETTING THE PARTY S TARTED

The adventure likely begins with the characters in the town of Dulwich in southern Ashlar. If you are setting this adventure in your own campaign world, consider having the adventurers start in a sizeable settlement close to the ruins. The characters will likely visit the ruins several times during this adventure, and having a nearby town they can retreat to for rest, healing, and replenishment is an important facet of the adventure.

Adventurers exploring Dulwich will inevitably discover one or more reasons to visit the Shadowed Keep. (Refer to "Starting Adventure Hooks" for more information.)

If the party is weak or inexperienced, consider running them through *Shunned Valley of the Three Tombs* before progressing to the Shadowed Keep.

#### BUYING EQUIPMENT

Dulwich is a decent-sized town situated on a busy trade route. Thus, all normal mundane equipment is available for purchase at normal prices. Unless detailed in the text, magic items are not usually for sale in Dulwich.

#### STARTING ADVENTURE HOOKS

Before the characters set forth to explore the Shadowed Keep, determine why they seek to investigate the ruins. You can use one or more of the hooks below or design your own.

#### WANTED BANDITS

The characters have heard of the bandit raids apparently emanating from the Shadowed Keep. As neophyte adventurers, they resolve to end the threat and claim the reward offered by Wido Gall.

Wanted posters (Player Handout 1 and 2) nailed to Dulwich Keep's gates (Dulwich location 1) and around town provide details of two particularly odious bandits. The two bandits are:

- **The Half-Orc Deserter Bareli**: Wanted for slaying her sergeant and deserting the Dulwich garrison Bareli has a bounty of 25 gp on her head.
- **The "Bandit Queen" Firean Maiethil**: Wanted for a diverse range of crimes including (but not limited to) theft, assault, murder and arson, the so-called Bandit Queen is known throughout Ashlar. She has a bounty of 150 gp on her head.

Both of the rewards are contingent on the wanted person being returned alive to Dulwich Keep. In this way, they can be tried and publicly executed as a warning to others thinking of taking up a life of banditry.

#### <span id="page-13-0"></span>TH E LOST MAPS

**Saini Alanen** (Dulwich location 9; NG female human; Appendix 1) believes Valentin Ironwolf owned a pair of maps showing the location of the lost dwarven hold of Vongyth. She greatly desires the maps and offers the characters 100 gp each to retrieve them from the ruined keep. She offers each character an advance of 20 gp to purchase equipment and supplies for their adventure.

**Learning About Vongyth**: A character making an Intelligence (History) check may know something about Vongyth. A dwarf native to Ashlar automatically knows the information revealed by a DC 15 check and gains advantage on any checks made to recall further information. A successful check reveals all information gained by a lesser check.

- **DC 10**: Vongyth was a dwarven hold known for its deep mines and industrious folk. Two centuries ago, a pair of dragons and their kobold minions slaughter or drove out the dwarves. Forty years later, the Crimson Swords—a famous adventuring band—slew the dragons and brought forth a great treasure from the ruined hold.
- **DC 15**: Adventurers sometimes go south to find and explore Vongyth in hopes of recovering lost treasures. Few return and it is assumed they never found the hold or that something terrible yet lurks in the dwarves' fallen home.
- **DC 20**: Before his death Valentin Ironwolf—enticed by the stories of the dwarves' treasure—was said to have been planning an expedition to Vongyth. Some say, he'd even found an old map or two of the place.

Saini Alanen knows all the above facts. The maps she seeks are in locations W7 and M13. More about Vongyth appears on page 32.

#### PERSONAL HOOKS

A character could also have a personal reason for wanting to explore the ruin. Such reasons could include:

- **Glory & Wealth**: The characters know of Valentin Ironwolf and have heard rumours of his fabulous, lost wealth.
- **The Bandits Must Pay**: Bandits have wrought some great wrong on the character. Perhaps the character's family were attacked and robbed (or even killed) by bandits. Whatever wrong has been wrought, the character desires revenge.
- **Related to Valentin**: The character is distantly related to Valentin Ironwolf. (The Ironwolf family has sired many famed adventurers over the years). Having heard of their famous relative's supposed fate, they decide to investigate the keep. Such folk may covet items displaying the Ironwolf family crest. Such treasures include a fine longsword and shield hidden in Valentin's lost treasure vault (location D16).
- **A Miasma of Evil**: Lawful good clerics, paladins and those of a similar ilk could have been troubled by a dream of a singular sinister feel. In the dream, they looked down upon a ruined borderland keep. Their gaze seemed to be able to pierce the keep and the hill upon which it stood to reveal a gathering cloud of roiling, malign darkness. Such a dream is clearly a vision from their god and may warn of a great evil

gathering in the borderlands. Discovering the ruin they dreamt of was the so-called Shadowed Keep, the character has come to Dulwich to investigate. This dream relates to the Chasm of Ebon Depths (location U6) and the sinister peril lurking far beneath.

#### SHADOWED KEEP LORE

A character making an Intelligence or Intelligence (History) check may know something about the Shadowed Keep. A successful check reveals all information gained by a lesser check.

- **DC 10**: Originally named Ironwolf Keep, the abandoned fortress is now known as the Shadowed Keep on the Borderland or Valentin's Folly.
- **DC 15**: Valentin Ironwolf was a skilled warrior-adventurer who built the place forty years ago. Valentin's enemies—the goblins and orcs of the surrounding woodlands—slew him, his family and retainers at the climax of a years-long, savage conflict.
- **DC 20**: Valentin was a successful adventurer and was rumoured to have hidden his treasure at the keep.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters will likely want to learn as much about the Shadowed Keep as possible. A character spending 1d4 hours (and 2d6 sp on drinks and bribes) asking around in taverns and markets may learn something about the Shadowed Keep. Such a character making a DC 10 Charisma check learns one rumour and one additional rumour for every 5 points by which their check exceeds DC 10. If the character spends 2 gp or more on drinks and bribes, they gain advantage on their Charisma check.

#### **D20 RUMOUR**

- 1PF Valenin Ironwolf was fantastically wealthy and hid much of his loot in a secret treasure vault below the keep.
- 2-3F Kaarina Ironwolf owned a magnificent necklace of gold and pearls that disappeared with the fall of the fortress.
- 4-6PF Wolves lurk in the woodlands surrounding the keep; some have preternatural powers of stealth.
- 7-9 Bandits lurk in the ruins; led by a vicious she-devil they rob and murder those using the nearby roads. Exsoldiers and thieves make up their ranks.
- 10-14 Goblins lurk in the ruins, claiming the cellars below the place as their realm. Not as numerous as they once were, the goblins still pose a threat to travellers and adventurers alike.
- 15-17 Two levels of cellars lie below the keep. The sole survivor of a previous expedition also spoke of an even deeper network of natural caverns.
- 18-19 A chapel lies below the keep; undead and other guardians may lurk within.
- <sup>20</sup> A ghost lurks in the donjon—the pitiful remnant of one of those who died during the keep's fall.

![](_page_15_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Ruler**: Wido Gall **Government**: Overlord

**Population**: 4,734 (4,634 humans, 15 dwarves, 3 elves, 11 half-elves, 8 half-orcs,

63 halflings)

**Alignments**: LG, NG, N, LN, LE, NE **Languages**: Common, Dwarven, Elven **Resources & Industry**: Lumber, pottery, wool

Dulwich stares out across the Salt Mire towards Hard Bay, the Forest of Gray Spires at its back. Just a few hundred years old, it rests on the remnants of numerous older structures built on a strip of dry land between the swamp and forest. One of the largest settlements in the Duchy of Ashlar, Dulwich is a major hub for merchants and travellers. A stout stone wall surrounds the main town, offering protection from the dangers lurking in the Salt Mire.

Wealth flows through the town in aplenty due to the lucrative timber industry and Dulwich's position as a trading centre. Its citizens live in well-constructed two-storey homes of stone (harvested from earlier settlements) and wood. While most of its streets remain hard-packed dirt, cobblestone paved roads have begun to appear in more affluent areas. A recently built keep lies at Dulwich's centre, built over an older wooden fortification. Its towers barely top the tall spire of the nearby Temple of Conn, a magnificent cathedral built with contributions from the town's affluent citizens.

Many of Dulwich's citizens are craftsmen, merchants or traders of some sort, with many more involved in logging. Guilds form the backbone of Dulwich, not just as a source of trade and income but also as a way of life. A few businesses cater to outsiders, particularly adventuresome types. To the west and south lies the ruins of Valentin's Folly, a small castle frequently sheltering wanted bandits (and—it is rumoured—much worse things). Within the forest, a day to the south, lies the feared and legendary Shunned Valley, believed by the locals to be haunted. These are just two nearby attractions. The great doom-drenched halls of Gloamhold lie far to the north.

Dulwich still mourns the recent death of the former high priest of Conn, Taistro Rintala. His successor, the young priestess Vuokko Laiten, now heads the temple due to the support of influential merchants who seek to use her as a political pawn for power, particularly against Dulwich's ruler, Wido Gall. Wido relies on the Temple of Conn for public support. Wido was scheming with the high priest to wrest complete control of nearby Longbridge from his rival, Hilduin Lorsch, a plan now disrupted. Wido seeks to expand his power to stymie the growing power of the merchant class flush with gold from the profitable lumber industry.

# TOWNSFOLK

**Appearance**: Dulwichians are typically fair-skinned with brown or sandy-coloured hair and blue, hazel or brown eyes. Men prefer long moustaches without beards, while women wear long hair in buns or piled up with elaborate tresses and pins for the wealthy.

**Dress**: Fine-spun woollen tunics and breeches for the working class are the norm, dyed in the colours of the various trades or guilds the Dulwichian is assorted with.

**Nomenclature**: *male* Einar, Jarmo, Pekka, Vesa; *female* Elena, Irja, Riita, Ulpo; *family* Eskola, Leino, Salonen, Takala.

#### TOWN LORE

A character may know something about Dulwich, its history and environs. A character making a DC 10 Intelligence check knows one or more pieces of information from the list below. A successful check gains everything revealed by a lesser check.

**DC 10**: Dulwich lies near the so-called Shunned Valley. It is a town of about 5,000 souls.

**DC 15**: The merchant guilds seek greater political power in the town, which is bringing them into conflict with Dulwich's lord, Wido Gall.

**DC 20**: Wido Gall is carefully gathering support to takeover the nearby village of Longbridge to gain control of the lucrative taxes generated by travellers crossing the village's bridge.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

While in Dulwich, a character may hear one or more whispers, rumours or pieces of news. A character making a DC 10 Charisma check learns one rumour from the table below. A character exceeding this check learns an additional rumour for every 5 points by which they exceeded DC 10.

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>LIFE I N DULWICH

Dulwich is a busy market town, but rising tensions between the affluent merchants, their guilds, and Wido Gall threaten its peaceful existence.

# TRADE & INDUSTRY

Dulwich is mostly known for its booming lumber industry, which employs many citizens and brings in great wealth. Though a significant source of income for the town, it is not Dulwich's only notable industry. Many citizens belong to the town's guilds, making everything from pottery to clothing, and members wear their guild's colours to denote their membership. The various guilds typically occupy entire streets and are growing ever more powerful and influential. No craftsman may operate in a trade without joining the relevant guild.

Other citizens work the farms outside Dulwich, most of which are owned by the Gall family. However, their wages are lower than those who learn a proper craft or trade. Thus, as the merchants grow in power and wealth, Dulwich's society becomes increasingly stratified.

Dulwichian goods travel throughout Ashlar, and merchants from the nearby villages often come to Dulwich to trade. Dulwich is an important centre of commerce in the duchy. If Wido Gall succeeds in taking control of Longbridge, he would control Kymis Run, which would bring him greater wealth and power. The merchants want to avoid this at all costs.

# LAW & ORDER

A well-equipped town guard imposes order in Dulwich, led by the respected captain, Tuula Tenbaran. Lawbreakers are imprisoned in the dungeons beneath Dulwich Keep. Because Wido Gall oversees all trials of note, many of the merchant class suffer stiffer fines and penalties, which compel them to scheme against their lord even further. The merchants, of course, would love to have Tuula Tenbaran in their pocket, but she remains stubbornly loyal to Wido. Several guilds have spent considerable coin both in wooing Tuula and in trying to uncover her weaknesses and vulnerabilities thus far for little result.

A recent push by the guilds calls for the establishment of fair and impartial (or easily bribed) courts of law with stricter oversight. Vuokko Laiten finds herself in the middle of this feud as the merchants petition the Temple of Conn for support, which was previously denied by the former high priest. Vuokko struggles to consolidate her own power and find a satisfactory resolution to the problem. She favours having the faithful—under her guidance take on a larger role in judging legal matters. However, both the nobles and merchants fear granting the temple too much power.

While the characters are in Dulwich, one or more of the below events may occur. Choose or determine randomly:

#### **2D8 EVENT**

| 2  | Large logs suddenly roll from the back of a wagon,<br>causing a minor panic in the street as townfolk scramble<br>to get out of the way.                                                           |
|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3  | A small procession of acolytes from the Lawgiver's Hall<br>muttering prayers and blessings to passers-by file down<br>the street, swing censers filled with incense.                               |
| 4  | A group of merchants pelt a passing carriage with<br>rotting vegetables. They run off when the town guard<br>approaches.                                                                           |
| 5  | A blacksmith demonstrates the sharpness of a newly<br>forged axe by hewing logs cleanly in half for a potential<br>customer.                                                                       |
| 6  | A mournful funeral procession makes its way towards<br>the cemetery, where a patrol of guardsmen stands<br>uneasily as if expecting trouble.                                                       |
| 7  | A sudden rain turns the streets to mud which seems to<br>spatter onto everything and everyone.                                                                                                     |
| 8  | The smell of hot mutton stew wafts from a street-side<br>stall, attracting a group of skinny children in ratty<br>clothing, much to the cook's annoyance.                                          |
| 9  | A small, lean shepherd, really only a child, leads a herd<br>of woolly sheep towards Wool Street with the help of a<br>tireless dog who keeps the sheep from straying.                             |
| 10 | A scrawny man in a noble's livery struggles to carry a<br>large, ornate vase down the street. He almost crashes<br>into several people as he totters along.                                        |
| 11 | Townsfolk pelt two men and a woman imprisoned in a<br>stockade set up near the keep. Signs proclaiming their<br>crimes hang from the convicts' necks.                                              |
| 12 | The town guard attempts to disperse an angry group of<br>workers upset with a tax rise. A few of the workers begin<br>to throw stones.                                                             |
| 13 | Two skeletons lumber out from Dulwich Cemetery,<br>staggering towards a young couple and their child.                                                                                              |
| 14 | Three thugs smash pottery in front of a crying woman at<br>her shop, telling her she needs to "wise up." Other<br>citizens nearby pretend not to notice. The thugs are<br>from the Shadow Spiders. |
| 15 | A young lad standing on the back of a cart shouts that<br>Saini Alanen is seeking brave men and women for a<br>dangerous job.                                                                      |
|    | Six guards, led by a woman wearing a metallic mask,                                                                                                                                                |

lead a bedraggled merchant in chains towards Dulwich Keep. A few onlookers pelt the merchant with offal.

<span id="page-18-0"></span>Most of Dulwich comprises peasant homes and businesses of little note. A few locations, however, are of interest to adventurers:

- 1. **Dulwich Keep**: Seat of the Gall family, the squat Dulwich Keep lies at the heart of Wido Gall's machinations. The town guard is based here, and the dungeons below the keep house lawbreakers and those who fall foul of Wido.
- 2. **The Lawgiver's Hall**: The lofty spire of this elaborate cathedral dominates Dulwich's skyline. Its new high priestess— Vuokko Laiten—is courted by both sides in the ongoing struggle for power in the town.
- 3. **Lumberyard and Guild Hall**: The lumber guild is particularly wealthy and influential; their holdings reflect their status.
- 4. **The Dancing Bear**: Run by the former half-elven adventurer Nurlon Rekinen this is a popular drinking establishment for adventurers and off-duty guardsmen.
- 5. **Nalthra's Jewellery**: Nalthra is the most renowned jeweller in Dulwich. She dwells in the top floor of this three-storey building. She might not always offer the best price for gems and jewellery, but she can handle large deals.
- 6. **The East Gate**: This sprawling inn is popular with Dulwich's wealthy and well-to-do. The Black Cats—a gang of skilled burglars—have infiltrated the place and spy on rich marks.
- 7. **The Golden Skull**: This dingy, forgettable watering hole is secretly the Shadow Spider's headquarters. A fighting pit and gambling hall lie beneath the tavern.
- 8. **Eronen's Safe Travels**: The retired, one-armed adventurer Henni Eronen runs this large, well-stocked general store.
- 9. **Saini Alanen's House**: Home to Dulwich's most renowned sage, the ground floor of this building also serves as a public library. The wizardess dwells on the top floor and is available to hire for private research projects.
- 10. **Cemetery and Catacombs**: The town graveyard; recently, rumours of strange goings-on have begun to cluster about the catacombs and surrounding mausoleums.
- 11. **Dulwich Marketplace**: This bustling daily market hosts numerous stalls and booths. Street performers are rife here, as are wandering merchants and pickpockets. Anything for sale in Dulwich can be had here. Many of the more affluent merchants maintain shops or businesses elsewhere.
- 12. **Dulwich Poorhouse**: Here dwell those who have nowhere else to go. The poorhouse is a hard, bleak place. Chancellor Aadam Ehtaro presides here and oversees the daily hire.
- 13. **Vilimzair's Arms**: Named for the near-mythical bard and legendary pirate captain Vilimzair Aralivar, this tavern is popular with visitors to Dulwich and locals. Here can be found cheap, plentiful drink and bawdy, joyful entertainment.
- 14. **The Crooked House**: All is not as it seems at this family home and general shop. Herein, lurks a cult dedicated to Braal.
- 15. **Badger's**: Guarded by loyal mercenaries, this crenellated manor is a bank, moneychangers and private home.
- 16. **The Three Bells**: Popular with pilgrims visiting Lawgiver's Hall, this inn hides a dark secret: its owner is a mass murderer!

Most of the population are nothing more than hardworking peasants. A few, however, are of interest to adventurers:

- **Almina Mastonen** (location 6; CN female halfling **spy**) runs a crew of burglars calling themselves the Black Cats. She works at the East Gate Inn.
- **Bernhard "Badger" Ilmatoivia** (location 15; LN middle-aged male human **knight**) maintains a good reputation as a man of character. This ex-adventurer runs Badger's and is rumoured to be fabulously wealthy.
- **Henni Eronen** (location 8; CG female human **scout**) runs Eronen's Safe Travels. A former adventurer, Henni is extremely knowledgeable about the town's surrounds.
- **Kerttuli Ilmarinen** (location 14; NE female human **Braalite priest**) works at the Crooked House by day and venerates Braal by night in the house's deepest, mould-ridden cellar.
- **Nalthra Rekunen** (location 5; N middle-aged female half-elf **commoner**) frequently seeks precious gems to work into pieces of art but is renowned for not offering good prices. Nalthra is a renowned jeweller.
- **Nurlon Rekunen** (location 4; LG middle-aged male half-elf **veteran**) runs the Dancing Bear, which caters to adventurers and travellers. He is a former adventurer and Nalthra's twin.
- **Orkus Darzak** (location 11; CE male dwarf **priest** [Braal]) worships Braal by animating the dead of Dulwich. Driven insane while adventuring in Gloamhold, Orkus lurks in the tunnels and catacombs beneath the cemetery.
- **Ossi Karppanen** (location 3; LN male human **commoner**) leads the lumber guild and seeks to instate a ruling council of merchants. He is one of Dulwich's richest citizens and consequently has much power and influence.
- **Saini Alanen** (location 9; NG female human [Appendix 1]) oversees a small, independent library where she conducts research on the local area and assists in political matters.
- **Tuula Tenhunen** (location 1; LN female half-orc **knight**) leads the town guard and is fiercely loyal to Wido Gall. She has the nickname the "Iron Maiden" due to the mask she wears.
- **Valto Ilakka** (location 16; NE middle-aged male human **assassin**) runs the Three Bells and is a mass murderer who preys on patrons that won't be missed.
- **Voitto Markku** (location 7; LE male human **spy**) leads the Shadow Spiders. He is an odious, dangerous fellow.
- **Vuokko Laiten** (location 2; LN female human **priest** [Conn]) serves as Conn's high priestess in Dulwich. She is young for the role, and some see her as unsuitable. Both Wido Gall and the merchants vie for her favour.
- **Wido Gall** (location 1; LN male human **mage**) rules Dulwich. He seeks to extend his influence to the nearby village of Longbridge, at the expense of his rivals.
- **Zado** (location 11; CN male human unknown) plies his trade in the marketplace as a street performer or, perhaps, street performers. However, this enigmatic performer's real trade is in secrets and information.

<span id="page-19-0"></span>The Gall family rule Dulwich, as they have since the town was founded centuries ago. However, the merchant class are becoming increasingly influential in the town's day-to-day affairs, and a clandestine struggle is going on for power. Recently, this struggle has spilt out into the town's religious life, with both the guilds and Wido Gall attempting to secure the support of the new high priestess of Conn—Vuokko Laiten (location 2; LN female human **priest** [Conn]). Four guilds, the Blacksmiths', Potters', Lumber and Woolmans', dominate Dulwich's mercantile life.

#### BLACKSMITHS ' GUILD

The Blacksmith Guild incorporates Dulwich's few armourers and weaponsmiths as well as the regular blacksmiths, making them one of Dulwich's largest and most important guilds. Guild members regularly cooperate with one another, especially in the training and housing of apprentices. Unlike the potters, guild members have few familial ties with one another. Skilled blacksmiths pass down their secrets to favoured apprentices.

Lately, friction between the blacksmiths and the armourers and weaponsmiths threatens to split the guild. The latter two get most of their business from the nobility and the town guard. Since their allegiance lies with the nobility, they are seeking to create their own guild separate from the blacksmiths. The blacksmiths hope to keep the armourers and weaponsmiths in their ranks to bolster their power. Hannu Aalto (LN male old human **commoner**) produces the finest swords in Dulwich and is said to be working exclusively for Wido Gall to supply weapons for certain mercenary groups in the noble's employment.

#### LUMBER GUILD

Perhaps the richest and most influential of Dulwich's guilds, the Lumber Guild maintains extensive operations in the southern woods. Such is the guild's influence that they operate and maintain their own town gate. Guildmaster Ossi Karppanen (LN male human **commoner**) is a shrewd man who sees much profit to be made in an alliance of guilds. He lobbies his fellow guild masters on such an arrangement on a monthly basis but is resisted by those fearing a loss of their own power and prestige. Of Dulwich's guilds, the Lumber Guild is the most likely to hire adventurers—the guild's operations in the southern woods always require skilled and vigilant guards.

#### POTTERS ' GUILD

Several close-knit families comprise the Potter Guild. As Dulwich expands, the guild's profits increase. Heads of the potter families actively lobby for higher taxes on imports while they use their size to bully their way into the smaller markets of the nearby villages. Their main rivals are merchants from the duchy's capital, Languard. Both the Gall family and the coalition of Dulwich's guilds actively court the potter guild with promises to help expand their reach and increase profits. The potter guild often swings in its allegiance toward whoever can benefit it at that time.

The pottery trade is passed down through the individual families, though it is not uncommon for a family to actively recruit apprentices from the outside (especially those who show unusual talent). Though rivalries often occur between gifted potters, the families tend towards the specialisation of particular pieces and are well known for their unique styles.

The guild quickly settles disputes between the families for the good of the guild, which always comes first. Jani Keto (LN male human **commoner**), one of the guild's most promising potters, has recently found himself deeply in debt with the Shadow Spiders due to his gambling habit. The Shadow Spiders hope to use Jani to muscle into the guild.

#### WOOLMANS ' GUILD

Though not the largest guild in Dulwich, the Woolmans' Guild benefits greatly from its ties with the clergy of Lawgiver's Hall, who have a large investment in the guild. Many of the young shepherds tending herds of sheep on the low hills outside Dulwich were once orphans living at the temple. The wool guild profits from the cheap labour (and the temple takes most of the shepherds' earnings to reinvest back into the wool guild). The temple, in return, gets a cut of the profits on wool sold to the weaver's and dyer's guilds as well as the associated wool merchants carrying the fleeces throughout the duchy. Because of their ties with the temple, the wool guild holds more influence than their size and profits would suggest. The guild sided with the other guilds early on to oppose the ruling nobility. When taxes go up, the wool guild frequently reminds the temple that its own profits are being adversely affected. Lalla Nikkonen (NG female human **druid**) works as a shepherdess and frequently acts as a guide in the surrounding countryside for adventuring parties to supplement her income.

# TH E THIEVES

Unlike Ashlar's capital city, Languard, Dulwich does not have a single, dominant thieves' guild. Rather, a patchwork of minor gangs struggle incessantly among themselves for territory, standing and profit. Most such gangs number no more than a dozen individuals, and most of their members are not particularly skilled. Dulwich's two most notable gangs comprise:

**The Shadow Spiders**: The most powerful (and violent) of Dulwich's gangs is the Shadow Spiders. Most of the other smaller gangs pay a proportion of their take to the Shadow Spiders to avoid bloodshed. Led by Voitto Markku (LE male human **spy**), the Shadow Spiders lair at the Golden Skull tavern (location 7).

**The Black Cats**: The halfling burglar Almina Mastonen (CN female halfling **spy**) leads the Black Cats gang. Popular with the peasantfolk, as the gang is generous with their ill-gotten gains, the Black Cats maintain several safe houses about the town. Almina works at the exclusive East Gate Inn (location 6) and uses her access to Dulwich's monied folk to plan her gang's jobs.

<span id="page-20-0"></span>Some of Dulwich's streets are notable for one reason or another.

**Amri Road**: Playwrights and poets live a bohemian lifestyle in the old buildings lining this street. The atmosphere is lively and a little debauched.

**Briar Park Row**: A small park rests along the street. Believed to be the remains of a former druid's grove, the park features a large oak tree with a life-like face etched into its trunk. Badgers' (location 15) stands on Briar Park Row, and the presence of its watchful, armed mercenaries makes this a particularly safe, crimefree street.

**Broad Street**: Well-appointed homes of relatively prosperous merchants line a wide tree-lined avenue often filled with playing children. Many secret guild meetings take place here.

**Dyer's Court**: Dulwich's wool dyers make their home on this street. Brightly coloured cloth hangs from the buildings and serves as a canopy over the street.

**Forger's Avenue**: The clanging of hammers accompanies thick smoke pouring from the forges of Dulwich's blacksmiths.

**Foundation Way**: Built upon the ruins of a former settlement, the homes here feature deep cellars. Many are rumoured to connect to the ancient tunnels below Dulwich, making the homes useful fronts for various gangs and those wishing to move about undetected. The Crooked House (location 14) stands on Foundation Way.

**Hargen's Court**: Also known as "Black Court," this short street is home to a thriving black market hidden in the tunnels below the cramped homes.

**High Road**: Many rich manses lie on this street, not named for its position in Dulwich but for the wealthy folk living here. Eronen's Safe Travels (location 8) stands on High Road.

**Hope's Alley**: An ancient, deep (and now defunct) well lies at the end of a cramped and crooked alley. A common superstition claims that throwing coins down the well helps avert tragedy or heal a sick loved one.

**Irkko Street**: An almost eerie silence hangs over this street where an ancient and weathered statue, its features indistinguishable, stands in a small courtyard. Legend claims it's a statue of an ancient goddess or hero from the time before Dulwich's founding.

**Jaska Alley**: This narrow street lives in the shadow of the buildings closing in on either side. Here, small shops sell strange herbs and other unusual curios.

**Korpela Street**: This long, twisted street features squat wooden buildings housing Dulwich's poorest citizens. Priests from Lawgiver's Hall frequently come here to help the impoverished citizens who are often preyed upon by thieves and unscrupulous traders alike.

**Leather Street**: Dulwich's leatherworking guild operates along this narrow, well-maintained street. The dingy (and dangerous) headquarters of the Shadow Spiders —the Golden Skull (location 7)—stand on Leather Street.

**Ojanen Street**: Most of the homes here feature newer construction due to a fire that claimed many buildings and lives years ago. A small shrine to Conn in commemoration of the tragedy rests at the end of the street. The always raucous Vilimzair's Arms tavern (location 13) stands on Ojanen Street.

**Potter Street**: Dulwich's many potters and their guild house lie on this street. Beautiful flowers displayed in elaborate vases welcome visitors to stroll and browse. The Potters' Guild has their guildhall here.

**Purho Street**: The first priest of the Temple of Conn is celebrated on this street with numerous small shrines and stalls selling religious objects and symbols. Lawgiver's Hall (location 2) stands on Purho Street.

**Rekunen Row**: Many prominent tailors and vintners conduct their business here. Well-tended flowerbeds—a matter of great pride to their owners—line both sides of the street. Dulwich's Marketplace (location 11) sprawls behind Rekunen Row.

**Steel Street**: Most of Dulwich's armourers and weaponsmiths operate out of the forgeries located here. The Dancing Bear (location 4) stands on Steel Street, as does the Blacksmiths' guildhall.

**Varala Way**: Named after a famous long ago defender of Dulwich, this street hosts a weather-worn statue of the hero. The East Gate Inn (location 6) and the Dulwich Poorhouse (location 12) stand on Varala Way

**Wool Street**: Located near the temple, the wool guild shears the sheep here and sells it to merchants. The Woolmans' Guild has their guildhall here.

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>IN- BETWEEN ADVENTURES

In between their adventures, the characters are likely to spend some time exploring Dulwich. Here they could sell loot, recover from their trials and so on. Use these notes to facilitate such play.

# BUYING & SELLING MAGIC ITEMS

Adventurers often find (or covet) magic items. Perhaps on an adventure, they find something they don't want, and they decide to sell it. Other times, they might desire a certain item—such as a magic sword, armour or wand.

While Dulwich does not have a thriving market for magic items, it is possible to sell and buy such items in the town. The best place to do either is Badger's (location 15), as its owner, Bernhard "Badger" Ilmatoivia, often sells magic items for clients.

#### STOCK O N HAND

Badger's stock changes on a regular basis as items are bought and sold. (The characters aren't the only people in town interested in buying magic items, and sometimes Bernhard sends items to the nearby city of Languard). Every week, roll on the list below to determine what is for sale at Badger's:

- 1. *Spell scroll of expeditious retreat* (25 gp), *potion of healing*  (10 gp).
- 2. *Potion of greater healing* (300 gp).
- 3. *Potion of healing* (15 gp), *potion of healing* (25 gp).
- 4. *Potion of climbing* (20 gp), *potion of healing* (35 gp), *spell scroll of shatter* (350 gp).
- 5. *Potion of climbing* (20 gp), *potion of greater healing* (300 gp), *potion of healing* (2; 30 gp each), *spell scroll of compelled duel* (15 gp), *spell scroll of detect poison and disease* (35 gp).
- 6. *Spell scroll of speak with animals* (30 gp), *spell scroll of protection from poison* (150 gp).

#### WHAT ELSE I S FO R SALE?

The characters may engage Bernhard to seek out rarer, more powerful and more expensive items. Doing so costs 100 gp and takes one week.

Roll on this list to determine what Bernhard has uncovered:

- 1. *Elemental gem* (150 gp), *potion of greater healing* (100 gp).
- 2. *Potion of greater healing* (100 gp).
- 3. *Potion of water breathing* (200 gp).
- 4. *Bag of holding* (400 gp), *helm of comprehend languages* (400 gp), *mithral chain shirt* (600 gp).
- 5. *Wand of magic detection* (600 gp).
- 6. *+1 arrows* (10; 175 gp or 18 gp each), *cap of water breathing* (100 gp), *potion of growt*h (200 gp), *spell scroll of spider climb* (100 gp).

#### SELLING MAGIC ITEMS

Bernhard is happy to purchase unwanted magic items from the party. He offers the following base prices:

- **Common Item**: 100 gp for a permanent item or 25 gp for a consumable item.
- **Uncommon Item**: 400 gp for a permanent item or 100 gp for a consumable item.

A character can try to increase Bernhard's offer with a Charisma (Persuasion) check.

- **DC 10 or Under**: The character's attitude annoys Bernhard and he reduces his offer by half.
- **DC 11 20**: Bernhard does not change his offer.
- **DC 21+**: Bernhard is swayed by the character's words and remembers he has a client who will pay a premium for this item. He increases his offer by half.

#### CAROUSING

Adventurers are famed for blowing off steam between their forays into the wilderness. Dulwich has several inns and taverns whose ostlers are more than happy to take the characters' coin.

Carousing is a good way for the characters to make local contacts (or enemies). Carousing characters automatically hear a rumour from either the Dulwich Whispers and Rumours table (page 12) or the Shadowed Keep Whispers & Rumours table (page 10) as you deem appropriate. They may also discover other adventure hooks.

#### CAROUSING WITH THE LOWER CLASS

Carousing at the Golden Skull costs 10 gp per week and introduces the character to Dulwich's lower class. While carousing with the lower class, the character may hear the following adventuring hooks:

| D20   | HOOK               | LOCATION |
|-------|--------------------|----------|
| 1-3   | Grave Matters      | 2        |
| 4-5   | Defeat the Spiders | 6        |
| 6-8   | New Spiders        | 7        |
| 9-12  | Mercenary Guards   | 8        |
| 13    | Let Me Serve You   | 11       |
| 14-16 | Missing Child      | 14       |
| 17-20 | Stolen Relic       | 16       |

#### <span id="page-22-0"></span>CAROUSING WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS

Carousing at the Dancing Bear, Three Bells or Vilimzair's Arms costs 50 gp per week. While carousing with the middle class, the character may hear the following adventuring hooks:

| D20   | HOOK              | LOCATION |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 1-3   | Grave Matters     | 2        |
| 4-5   | Other Places      | 4        |
| 6-9   | Guards Needed     | 5        |
| 10-13 | Mercenary Guards  | 8        |
| 14    | Vilimzair Defaced | 13       |
| 15-17 | Missing Child     | 14       |
| 18    | Missing Pilgrim   | 16       |
| 19-20 | Stolen Relic      | 16       |

#### CAROUSING WITH THE UPPER CLASS

Carousing at the East Gate Inn costs 250 gp per week and introduces the character to Dulwich's richest, most influential folk. While carousing with the upper class, the character may hear the following adventuring hooks:

| D20   | HOOK               | LOCATION |
|-------|--------------------|----------|
| 1-3   | Noble Intrigues    | 1        |
| 4-6   | Grave Matters      | 2        |
| 7     | Spies              | 3        |
| 8-13  | Defeat the Spiders | 6        |
| 14-15 | Auction            | 15       |
| 16-17 | Safe Storage       | 15       |
| 18-20 | Stolen Relic       | 16       |

#### REST & RECUPERATION

Adventurers can recover from diseases, poisons or other serious injuries in Dulwich between adventures. The character can do this at their lodgings (perhaps at the Dancing Bear or the Three Bells) or can seek professional help from the clergy at Lawgiver's Hall (location 2), which costs 6 gp.

After three days' rest, the character can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the character has engaged professional assistance, they gain advantage on this check. A successful save enables them to do one of the following things:

- End one effect preventing them from regaining hit points.
- Gain advantage on saving throws made against one disease or poison affecting them.

#### RESEARCHING

Between adventures, a character may want to learn more about the surrounding area or delve into the history of the Shadowed Keep and its fated master. Saini Alanen's House (location 9) serves as Dulwich's quasi-public library and is the best place for such research. The library houses the town's largest public collection of books, maps and so on regarding Dulwich and its surrounds.

Access to the library is free, but sundry expenses—delivered meals, quills, parchments and so on—amount to 1 gp per day (which is in addition to a character's normal lifestyle costs). Characters using the library for research can make Intelligence (Investigation) checks to discover the information they seek. Determine the difficulty of this check—and how many days the character must spend at the library—depending on what they wish to know.

#### WORK

Some characters may choose to practise their profession between adventures. There are ample opportunities to do so in Dulwich. Characters can pay for a modest lifestyle while working.

#### MERCENARY WORK

Mercenaries are always in demand in Dulwich. Whether needed to guard a merchant train or protect the lumber guild's workers as they cut and dress wood from the southern woods, those with keen wits and a ready sword can always gain employment.

A character earns enough to maintain a modest lifestyle every week they engage in mercenary work. Additionally, if the character makes a DC 15 Charisma check, they make a contact perhaps either their employer or another mercenary guard—who may be useful in the future. Characters making a Charisma check of DC 5 or less instead make a rival or enemy.

#### TH E PERFORMING ARTS

Bards, and those with proficiency in Charisma (Performance), can attempt to perform at the Vilimzair's Arms (location 13). Spots are in high demand, and the character must first persuade Sofia Ehtaro to let them perform during the coming week. Doing so requires a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A subsequent Charisma (Performance) check determines how much the character earns:

- **DC 10**: The character does not do particularly well and earns only enough to maintain a modest lifestyle.
- **DC 15**: The character performs well enough to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.
- **DC 20**: The character gets a rapturous reception and earns enough to support a wealthy lifestyle.

#### THIEVERY

Thieves and rogues should be careful not to come to the notice of Dulwich's various thieves' gangs. None of the gangs will be keen to have a freelancer working in their town; however, Almina Mastonen (location 6) may see such a freelancer as a tool to distract the more violent Shadow Spiders from persecuting the Black Cats.

# <span id="page-23-0"></span>1: DULWICH KEEP

Dulwich Keep is location 1 on the Dulwich map.

Completed a few decades ago, this small squat keep sits on a man-made hill surrounded by a dry moat. A stone wall, 25 feet high, surrounds the inner keep, a rectangular stone building with a tower on its east and west sides. Cramped with narrow passages, the keep seems to suck in the wet, humid air of the Salt Mire, making the walls constantly damp. Torches thick with more smoke than heat further clog the air. It's worse in the dungeons below, where lawbreakers are kept in cells that never see the light of day.

# DULWICH KEEP BY DAY

By day, Dulwich Keep is a hive of activity; here is conducted the essential business of running the town and Wido Gall's other holdings. The castle sees a steady stream of visitors and deliveries during the day. The town guard are also based at the keep, and patrols come and go throughout the day.

# DULWICH KEEP BY NIGHT

At night, the keep's main gate is closed, and guards patrol the battlements lit with blazing braziers. No one is admitted to the keep after dark unless they are known to the garrison or have special permission from Tuula Tenhunen or some another official.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at Dulwich Keep.

- **Tuula Tenhunen** (LN female half-orc **knight**) leads the town guard from the keep. She wears an iron mask to conceal her heritage (which is hardly noticeable) and serves Wido gladly, hoping he will use his magic to "correct" what she believes is a defect. She has earned the nickname the "Iron Maiden" due to her proclivity for heavy armour and her inflexibility in her pursuit of law and order.
- **Wido Gall** (LN male human **mage**), lord of Dulwich and one of Ashlar's most powerful nobles, dwells in the eastern tower with his immediate family. A noble of middle years, Wido finds himself growing concerned with the rising power of the merchant class, particularly the lumber guild. For financial gain, he seeks to seize control of nearby Longbridge from his rival, Hilduin Lorsch. He convinced Dulwich's former high priest of Conn to back his plan and generate public support, but with his death, things have gone awry as the new priest, Vuokko Laiten, does not support his goals.
- **Krister Janakka** (LN middle-aged male human **noble**) serves Wido Gall as Dulwich's reeve and deals with the town's mundane day-to-day business. No newcomer sees Wido Gall without first dealing with Krister. Wido trusts him as much as he trusts anyone. He is dour and stern but also exceptionally well-organised.

#### FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at Dulwich Keep, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Juhana Aikio, Sergeant of the Watch** (LN male human **veteran**) oversees the guards at the main gate and takes his job very seriously. If the characters seem suspicious, this grizzled veteran virtually interrogates them before allowing them entry. He is stocky, muscular, bald, and never without his chain armour and sword.
- 2. **Matti Jurva** (CN male human **guard**) serves in the keep's garrison but is in trouble. He has serious gambling debts with Shadow Spiders and is desperate to pay what he owes mainly to avoid a serious beating, permanent injury or even death. He might offer to do the characters favours—letting them into the keep at night, passing a message to a prisoner languishing in the dungeons and so on—if they will pay handsomely and discretely.
- 3. **Sirja Kare** (N female human **spy**) believes her husband languishes in Dulwich's Keep but can't confirm her suspicion. If the characters seem gullible, this smooth-talking, attractive conwoman spins a tale of her husband's heroic stand against Wido Gall's harsh rulership and begs them to help her free him. Much of her story is untrue; she and her husband are a skilled pair of confidence tricksters, and she is happy to use the characters as unwitting pawns in her struggle to free her husband. For all her faults, she loves him.
- 4. **Kosti Laso** (LE male human **noble**) owns several esoteric tomes he wants to sell to Wido Gall. This bearded, finelydressed man has thus far failed to get an audience and is growing frustrated. The characters provide an unforeseen opportunity—perhaps they know Wido Gall and can put in a good word for him? Kosti's books are valuable, and he is happy to invest time and gold in building a relationship with the characters if they can help him realise his goal. He doesn't want to sell the books to itinerant adventurers but might let them peruse them for a small fee.
- 5. **Antti Puukko** (LN male human **veteran**) works as a mercenary and is at the keep to see if the garrison needs another member. He has been rebuffed and is leaving as the characters arrive. He strikes up a conversation to see if the party needs a guard. He is not interested in being a full member of the party and going on dangerous delves and the like but would happily guard their camp or mounts. He is wellequipped and even owns a well-trained warhorse.
- 6. **Kaarina Tapo** (N female human **spy**) works for Tuula Tenhunen (see "Notable Folk") as a spy; she works in Dulwich, attempting to ferret out signs of discontent among the town's merchants. She is personable, skilled at small talk and often in disguise as a labourer, serving woman or suchlike. The characters could meet her repeatedly if she finds them intriguing or suspects the group is working against her master. She has mousey brown hair and is otherwise nondescript—perfect for her line of work.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at Dulwich Keep, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Delivery**: A covered wagon carrying foodstuffs and other staples rumbles into the keep. A swarm of workers quickly descend on it to unload. The air is thick with their shouts and the sounds of their labour.
- 2. **Town Guard Patrol**: A patrol of town guards is leaving as the characters arrive. They march past the characters before breaking into a more relaxed gait once out of sight of the guards on the castle's battlements.
- 3. **Robed Figures**: Two robed figures stand atop the keep surveying the town. One seems to be speaking particularly animatedly while the other listens.
- 4. **Fluttering Flags**: Flags flutter above the keep. Alongside Wido Gall's device is the pennant of the family Lankinen (lords of Kingsfell)—another of Ashlar's lords has come to visit Dulwich's sorcerous ruler.
- 5. **Moat Clearing**: A dry moat surrounds Dulwich Keep; a group of common labourers are removing trash and rubbish from the moat and excavating a small part to maintain its defensive capabilities. They are working—but not working hard.
- 6. **Iron Cages**: Iron cages hang from the wall above the keep's main gate. One cage holds a crumpled, unmoving form; the other contains a man wearing ragged clothes. His eyes are glazed, and he barely moves; he looks near death.

# OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Noble Intrigues**: Wido Gall seeks more agents to investigate and spy on his enemies at Longbridge. As a rich and noble lord, he has deep coffers to fund such activities. The characters catch the eye of one of his trusted servants, and they are approached—as a test—to fight the bandits plaguing the nearby roads.
- 2. **Gates Closed**: The keep's outer gates are closed, and no one is being admitted. The guards do not explain why; the characters must come back another time.
- 3. **An Escape**: An alarm bell begins to sound from somewhere deeper into the keep. A nearby soldier mutters, "Another escape?" before rushing off. The general confusion that ensues could offer the characters a useful diversion.
- 4. **Kaarina Intrigued**: **Kaarina Tapo** (see "Folk Out and About") spots the characters and is intrigued. Perhaps she overhears a snatch of conversation that leads her to suspect the party of ill-intent, or she is bored and decides to follow them for a couple of days. She uses a variety of disguises to keep an eye on them.
- 5. **An Escapee**: As #3 but one of the characters spots a ragged figure climbing over an unguarded part of the keep's outer wall. If the figure reaches the ground, they dash across the moat and try to disappear into the town. The characters can

- ignore the figure, catch them to get a reward and earn influence with Tuula Tenhunen (see "Notable Folk") or help the prisoner escape.
- 6. **Wido Gall Himself**: The characters are lucky (or perhaps unlucky) enough to be arriving at the keep when Wido Gall (see "Notable Folk") is being driven forth in his ostentatious carriage. The driver and the dozen mounted guards expect the characters to get out of the way. If they do not, serious trouble will inevitably ensue.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **In the Dungeons**: Criminals and Wido Gall's enemies are kept in the dungeons below Dulwich Keep. Conditions therein are terrible, and Wido Gall does not show mercy to his enemies or those threatening his rule.
- 2. **Bandits on the Borderlands**: Bandits again haunt the southern woodlands. Their raids are affecting trade. Several different groups are said to be in the vicinity; one such band is thought to lair in the ruined so-called Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands.
- 3. **Political Problems**: The village of Longbridge, which lies between Dulwich and Languard, is strategically important for trade in the duchy. It also does not currently have a lord—a situation Wido Gall, ruler of Dulwich—is keen to remedy.
- 4. **Plague**: The plague still savages the doomed village of Ashford. How anyone is still alive there, Darlen only knows. Something should be done about it. Militant folk call for the village to be burnt to the ground to contain the contagion.
- 5. **The Forest of Gray Spires**: The southern forests have long been a place of mystery and ruin. Ancient ruins lie scattered throughout the forest, ensuring a steady stream of adventurers and explorers pass through Dulwich on their way south. An exploration into the forest's depths is only for the bravest and most skilled adventurers; there is little help to be found in the forest's depths.
- 6. **Deep Cellars**: Foundation Way is aptly named. An older settlement once stood here, and the shops and homes are built over the top of it. Many of the buildings feature deep, multi-level cellars. Some folk speak of even older, deeper tunnels and share wild stories about what might lurk within.

![](_page_24_Picture_25.jpeg)

<span id="page-25-0"></span>The Lawgiver's Hall is location 2 on the Dulwich map.

One of the first structures built in Dulwich, the Temple of Conn (LN god of community, family and rulership), is undergoing another bout of renovation and expansion thanks to generous donations from its increasingly rich followers. The tall, elaborate stone cathedral dominates the town; from its magnificent bell tower rings a new silver bell. Another recent contribution paid for elaborate stained glass windows. A well-tended grove separates the cathedral from the well-appointed houses used by the clergy.

Less than a year ago, the beloved and respected high priest, Taistro Rintala, died unexpectedly. Some believe foul play was the cause, while others blame a sickness from the Salt Mire. A schism in the clergy between Wido Gall's supporters and those of the merchant guilds resulted in Vuokko Laiten, an inexperienced priestess in her twenties, becoming the new high priestess.

# TH E LAWGIVER' S HALL BY DAY

The Lawgiver's Hall is busy during the day. Folk come here to worship, get advice or meet fellow worshippers. Additionally, workmen are often in attendance repairing stonework, fixing furniture and so on.

# TH E LAWGIVER' S HALL BY NIGHT

After the last service of the day, the cathedral is quiet; a few worshippers linger for private prayer or reflection. A priest is in attendance all night to aid visitors, but the private areas of the cathedral are locked up. The clergy are not stupid; they know the faith is perceived as wealthy, and they do not make themselves easy marks for thieves.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the Lawgiver's Hall.

- **Vuokko Laiten** (LN female human **priest** [Conn]) leads Conn's faithful in Dulwich. While proficient and capable, Vuokko suffers from being the pawn between two opposing political parties—the nobles and merchants. Vuokko seeks some way to unite the two, but it's fast becoming apparent that she must soon choose a side.
- **Mikael Tuntia** (LN male human **priest** [Conn]) serves as Vuokko's lieutenant and deputy in all things. He is more than in a little love with Vuokko and gladly does anything she asks. Mikael is stout, has a horrendous haircut and is terrible at concealing his feelings.
- **Maija Vartia** (LN female human **knight**) oversees the cathedral guard—a 14-strong group of pious warriors who protect the hall and watch over its priests when they are abroad in the town or the wider duchy. She is strict, disciplined and well-respected.

#### FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the Lawgiver's Hall, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Lempo Toivettu** (LN male human **acolyte** [Conn]) serves Wido Gall and reports on all events of importance occurring at the hall. This stick-thin middle-aged man appears friendly, but perceptive characters get the feeling he is pumping them for information when they speak with him. He serves Gall through a mix of fear and avarice—Dulwich's lord pays him well but has also hinted at the awesome magical powers he could unleash on those who displease him.
- 2. **Heta Tiera** (LN middle-aged female human **commoner**) owns a small carting business and has come here to seek the clergy's advice on expanding to Longbridge. She seeks Vuokko's (see "Notable Folk") blessing and support. If she perceives the characters are adventurers, she tries to hire them as guards. She is comparatively wealthy but does not pay well. She's also quite acidic in her dealings with people she perceives as beneath her.
- 3. **Frans Koira** (N male human **veteran**) wants magical healing. Two thieves set upon him last night after a late-night debauch and wounded him before he near-beat them to death. He is evasive about the cause of the wounds, which could be seen as suspicious. Frans is in Dulwich as a spy, and he tries to keep a low profile. He is clever, handsome and personable. If the characters have doings with important Dulwichian folk, he tries to join their group.
- 4. **Ahti Asikka** (N male human **commoner**) wants influence in the town and isn't afraid to pay for it. He has come here to make a large donation to the faith's coffer and wants people to notice. Ahti is loud, slightly obnoxious and full of a sense of his own grandeur. He is also overweight, finely dressed and accompanied by a small crowd of hangers-on. Ahti has always wanted to have a "pet" band of adventurers at his beck and call; he may approach the characters if they seem desperate for funding.
- 5. **Lotta Otra** (N female human **spy**) plans to lift some of the church's finer, more portable decorations. She's hanging around in the shadows, pretending to be deep in prayer. She is casing the church; she knows it is quieter at night but is here to get a feel for the place and its staff. If the characters pique the interest of this plain-looking and nondescript quiet woman, she follows them to see if they might be easier marks. She carries only a dagger and the tools of her trade; she immediately flees if challenged.
- 6. **Maarit Kurikka** (LN female human **acolyte** [Conn]) hails from Languard and has come to Dulwich to serve at the cathedral for a year. She will not say what brought her here—perceptive characters get the impression she is ashamed of something but she knows much of Languard's recent events, particularly those involving, Gloamhold, adventurers and their doings. She is desperate to make new friends and willingly shares what she knows.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Lawgiver's Hall, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Busy**: The hubbub of conversation spills over the characters as they enter the hall. Many folk are here, and no priest is immediately available to speak with them.
- 2. **Quiet**: The characters have arrived at the hall during a rare peaceful moment. If they seek the attention of a priest, they can quickly secure such.
- 3. **Atypical Service**: The characters arrive while an atypical service—perhaps a wedding or funeral—is in progress. They must wait until it is over to get the attention of a priest. If they are not patient and respectful, they are politely asked to leave.
- 4. **Injured Believer**: A member of the congregation has been badly injured in an accident. As the characters arrive, two commoners push past them, carrying their friend on a makeshift stretcher. The injured commoner has just been run over by a cart and is near death.
- 5. **Heavy Rain**: Rain hammers Dulwich, and the cathedral roof begins to leak in a few places. Acolytes bring out buckets to catch the leaks. Clearly, the clergy need more donations to fix the roof; they aren't shy at making this point obvious to everyone present.
- 6. **Workmen**: Workers are preparing to repair a piece of masonry by erecting a wooden scaffold against a wall. They are loud, and the sound of their work fills the air.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Grave Matters**: The odd happenings at Dulwich Cemetery (location 10) concern Vuokko Laiten (see "Notable Folk"), and she seeks trustworthy folk to investigate. If she has had prior agreeable dealings with the characters, she approaches them about the matter.
- 2. **Merchants-at-Arms**: Two merchants are arguing violently over who gets the honour of supplying the clergy with ale and wine. The two are close to blows and decide trial by combat is the best way to resolve the problem; they both immediately try to hire a character as their champion.
- 3. **Favour for a Favour**: If the characters seek a favour from the clergy—perhaps magical healing or advice—Vuokko Laiten (see "Notable Folk") waives the fee in return for the characters investigating the odd doings at the Dulwich Cemetery (location 10).
- 4. **Who Are You?** Maija Vartia (see "Notable Folk") takes an interest in the characters. She strikes up a conversation to learn more about them. This could be good or bad for them, depending on how they answer.
- 5. **Fire**: Someone accidentally knocks over a candle, which sets fire to a tapestry; minor panic ensures.

6. **Perching Owl**: A white owl has flown into the cathedral and started nesting high up in the rafters. Some of the clergy want it gone, while others see it as a good omen.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Murder Most Foul**: Taistro Rintala—the hall's previous high priest—was murdered! Dulwich's politics is fractious at the moment, and many powerful folk had reason to install their puppet as high priestess.
- 2. **Intrigues and Donations**: The cathedral has recently received several large donations. Various wealthy worshippers seek to sway the priesthood into their camp—for what purposes, it is hard to say.
- 3. **Reluctant Leader**: Vuokko Laiten (see "Notable Folk") didn't want to be high priestess; she was the compromise between the various factions jockeying for power. Everyone thinks they can influence her.
- 4. **Tax the Rich**: Things are good in Dulwich, and its folk grow wealthy—particularly the town's merchants. Wido Gall is planning a new tax on the merchants, and they are not happy about it.
- 5. **Inept Leader**: Vuokko Laiten (see "Notable Folk") is too young and inexperienced to be the high priestess. She should be replaced by someone older with more presence in the community.
- 6. **Sickness Stalks the Land**: Sickness lurks in the Salt Mire. The village of Ashford is beset with plague, and now rumours tell of the Salt Mire's lizardfolk falling ill.

#### WHAT' S FO R SALE

Some of these items may be for sale at the Lawgiver's Hall.

- 1. **Holier Water (4; 75 gp a vial)**: These small silver vials hold concentrated holy water, which is twice as effective as normal holy water.
- 2. **Silver Mace (200 gp)**: Intended as a ceremonial item, this beautiful two-handed mace could also serve as a potent weapon against vampires and the like. It is superbly forged and well-balanced.
- 3. **Law and Duty (150 gp)**: This thick, ornately illuminated book sets out Conn's teachings in great detail. It is the bedrock of the faith and the perfect gift or bribe for a believer or priest.
- 4. **Statuette of the Father (200 gp)**: This ivory statuette shows Conn dispensing justice. Conn is depicted holding a mace in one hand and a big book in the other.
- 5. **Magic Healing Potion (250 gp)**: This plain iron vial holds a *potion of greater healing*.
- 6. **History of Dulwich**: This treatise on Dulwich is a copy of the original, which is held in the church's vault. Some details have been changed in the text to strengthen Wido Gall's claim to the village of Longbridge.

# <span id="page-27-0"></span>3: LUMBERYARD AND GUILD HALL

The Lumberyard and Guild Hall is location 3 on the Dulwich map.

Such is the rich lumber guild's influence that a small gate pierces the town wall near the lumber yard. Trees are processed into lumber within these large buildings and shipped throughout the Duchy of Ashlar and beyond. The guild employs hundreds of citizens in the warehouses or as loggers on the fringes of the Forest of Gray Spires. Overseeing this massive operation is Ossi Karppanen. Ossi regularly meets with the other guild leaders in an effort to form an alliance against Wido Gall.

# TH E YARD AND GUILD HALL BY DAY

By day, almost no matter the weather, the yard is a hubbub of activity and industry. Tree trunks are dragged into the yard, where they are split and worked. Many workers, guards and visitors can be encountered here. In the guild hall, Ossi Karppanen conducts his business and holds court.

#### TH E YARD AND GUILD HALL BY NIGHT

By night, the yard and guild hall are quiet and all but empty. Several guards patrol the yard to keep thieves and the spies of rivals away. Sometimes, Ossi Karppanen holds late-night meetings or banquets at the guild hall; on such occasions, there are many more workers about the yard.

# NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at or near the Lumberyard and Guild Hall.

- **Ossi Karppanen** (LN male human **commoner**) is a shrewd man with an eye towards politics. As profits increase (and thus taxes owed increase), Ossi desires more and more to replace the ruling noble class with a council of merchants. He believes a merchant council would lead to greater riches and the expansion of Dulwich's economy (and to him paying less tax). To this end, Ossi has spies everywhere, even manipulating temple politics and using the Shadow Spiders gang (The Golden Skull, location 7) for intimidation.
- **Klaus Ampuja** (N male human **spy**) serves as the guild's fixer. He is dedicated to his job only because the pay is good and Ossi treats him well. Klaus couldn't care less about the state of the woodlands or the fate of those living within. He enjoys the cut and thrust of guild and town politics and takes great delight in bending folk to his will. He is not shy about using violence to achieve his goals but sees such distasteful methods as a last resort. Klaus is polite and respectful of all he meets—irrespective of his personal views toward them. He is a man who likes options and does not alienate others lightly.

#### FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the Lumberyard and Guild Hall, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Jegor Ihamuoto** (NG male human **scout**) visits the guild hall to see if there is any work for a skilled forester. A resolute but taciturn man, Jegor needs gold and has heard the guild is hiring warriors and the like to protect their workers in the southern woods. He is a good man and may baulk at some of the guild's activities. He has several friends among the woodland's peaceful denizens and may eventually begin to work against the guild.
- 2. **Jyrki Ahti** (N old male human **commoner**) sits outside the yard with a begging bowl. Jyrki is a skilled woodworker but lost an arm in a near-fatal accident several years ago. Unable to work, he resorts to begging to keep life and soul together. He sees much of what goes on here—and keeps a particular eye on the comings and goings of merchants, guild members and the like. He is happy to sell this information to anyone who will pay for it.
- 3. **Ilma Kaivas** (N middle-aged male human **commoner**) works as a carpenter and is at the lumberyard to inspect the wood. He is exceptionally skilled and is looking for just the right pieces of wood to craft a unique puzzle chest for a local wizard. Ilma loves his work and could talk about wood and joinery for hours. He is quite boring but clearly passionate about his work, which is in high demand.
- 4. **Inga Tornia** (LN female human **druid**) visits the lumberyard to remonstrate with Ossi Karppanen and other key officials. She is concerned that the guild's workers are taking too much from the forest without planting new trees. Some of the groups are getting dangerously close to certain sacred areas. This mousy and slender fur-clad woman is nearly vibrating with anger. If the guild does not listen to her concerns, trouble will almost certainly lie ahead.
- 5. **Willithar Pyloninn** (CG female elf **veteran**) finds the lumberyard a sad place. She has come here to pay her respects to the many trees needlessly and disrespectfully—as she sees it—cut down by the humans. Slender even for an elf, it looks like a strong breeze could break her, but Willithar has a steel core. She is an excellent archer who can move with great silence through the woods. She is not a Dulwich native and will not stay long in town unless given a good reason. She might join like-minded characters planning an expedition into the southern woods.
- 6. **Eeva Janakka** (N middle-aged female human **commoner**) stands outside the lumberyard, alternatively shouting and crying. Her husband, Eeva, did not return from a guild expedition into the southern forests; no one will tell her what happened. She doesn't even know if he is alive. She demands answers. If she notices the characters, she begs them to investigate for her—but she can't afford to pay them but offers them the shelter of her humble home.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Lumberyard and Guild Hall, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Busy**: The lumberyard is a hive of noise activity; logs are brought into the yard, where the workers split the wood to produce planks, lengths of timber and a tremendous amount of sawdust.
- 2. **Filling a Wagon**: Workers are busy around a wagon, which they are filling with planks and staves. The wagon is nearly full —someone is planning a large project. A fat and officious teamster oversees the wagon's loading but doesn't actually do any work.
- 3. **Smoke**: Wisps of smoke rise from a shed filled with sawdust and off-cuts of wood. A worker notices the smoke and cries of "Fire!" fill the air.
- 4. **Delivery**: Four heavily laden wagons trundle into the yard. Each slowly moving wagon holds cut tree trunks to be processed into planks and the like.
- 5. **Argument**: Snatches of shouting emanate from inside the guild hall. At least three individuals seem engaged in a blazing row. The argument continues for some time before a door loudly slams, and the voices quieten.
- 6. **Quiet**: The lumberyard is quiet—only a few workers are visible; the others rest after hours of hard work. In the guildhall, Ossi Karppanen (see "Notable Folk") is unavailable he is meeting with one of his peers.

# OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Mercenary Guards**: Ossi Karppanen (see "Notable Folk") is always open to hiring mercenaries to protect the woodcutters who risk life and limb venturing anywhere near the Forest of Gray Spires.
- 2. **Spies and Scouts**: Ossi Karppanen (see "Notable Folk") has heard rumours of colossal trees growing deep in the forest. Their wood would make excellent masts for ocean-going ships and so on. He wants to hire skilled "scouts" to plunge into the wilderness to locate the trees and ensure the environs are safe for his workers.
- 3. **Ossi Inspects**: Ossi Karppanen (see "Notable Folk") is inspecting a recent delivery of freshly cut trunks. He seems to be in a good mood from his demeanour and body language.
- 4. **Fire**: Someone has snuck into the lumberyard and doused a pile of sawdust and off-cuts with oil. The pile leans against the wall of one of the workshops. When the pile bursts into flames, the fire spreads quickly unless someone acts swiftly and decisively. If the characters help extinguish the flames, Ossi Karppanen (see "Notable Folk") is grateful and invites them to join him for a drink. He uses the opportunity to learn more about them and determine if they may be useful allies or pawns in his schemes.

- 5. **Injured Worker**: Moments before the characters arrived, a wood pile collapsed onto a worker, trapping them. The characters arrive to see a scene of chaos—workers are trying to free the trapped man while others look on. If the characters help, they gain the guild's thanks. The accident provides an excellent diversion if they are here for nefarious reasons.
- 6. **New Tax**: A town cryer—sent by Wido Gall—stands without the lumberyard, loudly announcing a new tax on finished wooden goods. Nearby, a soldier nails a copy of the proclamation to the gate. Several robed figures, Ossi Karppanen (see "Notable Folk") among them, stand outside the guild hall listening to the proclamation. They are not happy and are in no mood to receive guests.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Rise of the Merchants**: Dulwich's various guilds are gaining more power and influence every year. Wido Gall, ruler of Dulwich, seeks to stymie their ascension with ever more restrictive tariffs, taxes and laws. It is only a matter of time before serious trouble ensues as the two factions struggle for dominance.
- 2. **Tax the Rich**: Things are good in Dulwich, and its folk grow wealthy—particularly the town's merchants. Wido Gall is planning a new tax on the merchants, and they are not happy about it. Behind the scenes much political manoeuvring and machinations are occurring. One thing is certain: whoever wins the struggle, the townsfolk will inevitably lose.
- 3. **The Forest of Gray Spires**: The southern forests have long been a place of mystery and ruin. Ancient ruins lie scattered throughout the forest, ensuring a steady stream of adventurers and explorers pass through Dulwich on their way south. Some of the forest's trees are said to be ancient and immense—such specimens represent a great natural treasure and resource for the lumber guild.
- 4. **Bandits on the Borderlands**: Bandits again haunt the southern woodlands, and the authorities are offering rewards for bandits brought alive to Dulwich Castle so that they can make bloody examples of what happens to these challenging Wido Gall's rule. Bandit raids affect trade and the town's guilds are also keen for the problem to be solved. Several different groups are said to be in the vicinity; one such band is thought to lair in the ruined so-called Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands.
- 5. **Political Problems**: The village of Longbridge, which lies between Dulwich and Languard, is strategically important for trade in the duchy. It also does not currently have a lord—a situation Wido Gall, ruler of Dulwich—is keen to remedy.
- 6. **Cover Up**: The lumber guild often covers up their activities because their workers die with alarming regularity. Some groups don't return from the forest at all—that's why the guild is always looking for reliable guards. The guild's master, Ossi Karppanen (see "Notable Folk"), is not to be trusted.

# <span id="page-29-0"></span>4: TH E DANCING BEAR

The Dancing Bear is location 4 on the Dulwich map.

The ridiculous image of a dancing frocked bear adorns the outside of this rambling three-storey inn and tavern. Stuffed and mounted heads, showing their age, of wild beasts and even a few monsters, adorn the cavernous common room's walls. These are the mementoes of the inn's proprietor, the retired adventurer Nurlon Rekunen.

- **Food & Drink**: Meal (omelette with nuts and vegetables or leek and chestnut stew; 3 sp), mug of ale (4 cp), pitcher of good wine (2 sp).
- **Accommodation**: A standard room costs 2 sp a night. The room is large and well—if plainly—furnished.
- **Lifestyle**: Characters at the Dancing Bear can enjoy a modest (1 gp/day) or comfortable (2 gp/day) lifestyle.

#### TH E DANCING BEAR BY DAY

By day, the Dancing Bear is quiet. A few customers—typically those staying in the inn—linger in the common room nursing their hangovers. The inn's staff quietly go about their day, cleaning, tidying and restocking the common room's bar.

# TH E DANCING BEAR BY NIGHT

By night, the Dancing Bear comes alive. It has a reputation for wild nights, and those seeking to let off steam often end up at the Dancing Bear. Entertainment is a common occurrence at the Dancing Bear—bards, storytellers, travelling troupes of actors, and the like know it is a good place to put on a show. The tavern stays open until the early hours but is noticeably quieter after midnight.

# NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the Dancing Bear.

- **Nurlon Rekunen** (LG middle-aged male half-elf **veteran**) bought the inn well over a hundred years ago and is something of a local legend. The bearded Nurlon and his twin sister Nalthra Rekunen (location 5) were raised by their human mother and her family. Generations of his brothers' and sisters' descendants have since lived and died, and Nurlon is a bit morose when in his cups.
- **Sanni Rekunen** (CG young female human **commoner**) works at her uncle's inn and thoroughly enjoys herself. Entertainment is in her blood, and she loves meeting new people. Barely 16, she already sees herself as an excellent host and practically in charge of the tavern. Nurlon indulges her delusion.
- **Liekko Unaja** (N middle-aged female human **commoner**) started work at the Dancing Bear two decades ago and is a fixture of the place. Now, she runs many of the day-to-day operations for Nurlon. He trusts her, and she, in turn, is loyal to him. Liekko also has an excellent singing voice and

sometimes joins other performers on stage. If she had enjoyed a better start in life, she could have been a renowned singer. She knows this, and it saddens her. She is a tall but dumpy woman.

# FOLK I N THE TAPROOM

While the characters are at the Dancing Bear, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Albin Joutsi** (N male human **veteran**) stays at the Dancing Bear while plotting his next move. He's had some minor success adventuring but has recently discovered how dangerous such a life can be. He won't talk about his recent experiences and spends his evenings drinking slowly but heavily. He loves the entertainment at the Dancing Bear—it helps him forget his worries.
- 2. **Stiina Toiva** (LN female human **commoner**) wants to sell Nurlon a consignment of wine on behalf of her master—a wealthy merchant in Languard. Her problem is that the shipment is in Languard, banditry is on the rise and trouble in the village of Longbridge further complicates matters. She needs a group of trustworthy guards.
- 3. **Sirja Hopea** (CN female human **spy**) lingers in the common room, watching for easy marks. She isn't insane enough to pick the pocket of an obvious adventurer or mug someone, no matter how worse for wear they are. Rather she pilfers a few coins from drunk customers who will likely never notice the theft. She flirts with her marks but is careful never to take things too far.
- 4. **Daim Azcral** (LG male dwarf **veteran**) enjoys a mug (or four) of ale. New to Dulwich, he has come here to fight goblins and whatever other foul beasts lurk in the southern forest. He is loyal and dependable but inflexible. He is also convinced of dwarven superiority in almost all matters. His conversation can be boring as he Sgoes on and on and about dwarven culture and achievements but he is a skilled warrior. He will join a group of like-minded adventurers planning expeditions into the southern wilderlands for an equal share of the spoils.
- 5. **Kaarlo Ano** (NE male human **bandit**) works as a spy for a bandit gang lurking in the southern woods. He is here to get information about wealthy merchants and their movements. He pretends to be a mercenary guard. If the characters try to hire him, he comes up with increasingly spurious reasons why he cannot serve them. Kaarlo has a certain level of base cunning, but he is no genius. He is handsome and believes himself to be virtually irresistible to women.
- 6. **Rister Vilja** (CE male half-elf **assassin**) lingers in the taproom. He has recently come to Dulwich to complete a job—the slaying of Tuula Tenhunen (the leader of the town guard)—and has taken a room here to get a feel for the town. Rister is a cautious fellow, and he is content to stalk his prey for weeks. Rister also always likes to have a backup plan and might see the characters as useful dupes or diversions. Utterly without morals, he has no qualms about destroying other people's lives or reputations.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Dancing Bear, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Sing Song**: When the characters arrive, the clientele in the common room is in the midst of a raucous sing-song. It is noisy and busy. Liekko Unaja see "Notable Folk") is leading the singing and enjoying herself immensely.
- 2. **Dancing Bear**: A visiting bard has brought his trained dancing bear to the tavern (for obvious reasons). The bear capers about the common room while the customers—some nervously—watch. The bear has a taste for ale and sometimes steals customers' drinks. Wisely, no one objects.
- 3. **Pocket Picked**: A perceptive character notices Sirja Hopea (#3 "Folk in the Taproom") pick the pocket of a drunk and inattentive merchant deep in an animated conversation with a friend. She flees if confronted.
- 4. **Celebrating Brave Sir Ozloc**: A group of friends sit at a table, laughing and joking. They celebrate brave Sir Ozloc's most recent triumph—catching himself with his own *sleep* spell while fleeing a disastrous encounter with a dragon. The group is in good spirits, and the ale is flowing freely. (Sir Ozloc is an adventurer active in the Dunstone area who has gained a reputation for daring escapes and swift retreats).
- 5. **Quiet Night**: The Dancing Bear is quiet. Perhaps the weather is terrible, or the entertainment is awful, and the patrons have voted with their feet. The patrons present sit in small groups, drinking and chatting quietly. The inn's staff are enjoying the unusually easy night, and most are in a talkative mood; characters chatting with them gain two rumours from " Whispers & Rumours".
- 6. **Peddlar Peddling**: Piri Repo (CN middle-aged male human **commoner**) sells poor-quality jewellery to drunk, befuddled patrons. He moves about the common room peddling his wares until chased out by the staff.

# OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Nurlon's Old Adventures**: If Nurlon takes a shine to someone, he tells stories of his adventures in the southern forests. In this way, the characters could learn of the Shunned Valley of the Three Tombs, Elle's Mere or the Valley of Bones.
- 2. **Gems to Sell**: If the party has gemstones for sale, Nurlon sends them to his sister, Nalthra (location 5 on the Dulwich map; N middle-aged female half-elf **commoner**). Sometimes, she visits the Dancing Bear, and Nurlon gladly introduces her to likely customers.
- 3. **Magic Ring for Sale**: Hille Ilakka (NG female human **knight**) has a *ring of mind shielding* for sale. She wants 500 gp for the ring as she needs the money to pay for a friend's desperately needed magical healing.
- 4. **Guards, Guards**: Stiina Toiva (# 2 "Folk in the Taproom") needs guards for a shipment of wine. She either approaches

- the characters or Nurlon introduces them. If the characters accept the job, they could come into (violent) contact with the bandits lurking in the so-called Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands or become embroiled in Longbridge's political problems when the reach the contested village.
- 5. **Digging for Information**: Kaarlo Ano (#4 "Folk in the Taproom") approaches the party under the pretence of sharing news about the road. His goal is to discover the party's plans so his comrades can avoid them. He has had too much to drink and is not his subtle self.
- 6. **Drunken Mercenary**: Pietari Urho (N male human **veteran**) has drunk way too much and is annoying Sanni Rekunen (see "Notable Folk") with his lecherous advances. Pietari is a large, burly fellow, and several of the worried regulars watch over her. If the characters intervene, they could make several friends among the inn's staff and clientele.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Nurlon's Glory Days**: In his youth, Nurlon was an adventurer who explored the southern forests. He knows much of what lurks beneath its boughs. He bought the Dancing Bear with the proceeds of his adventures over 100 years ago.
- 2. **The Shadowed Keep**: An old keep lies in the woodlands to the south of Dulwich. Once home to Valentin Ironwolf, the place is now a ruin. Who knows what foul things lurk within?
- 3. **Political Problems**: The village of Longbridge, which lies between Dulwich and Languard, is strategically important for trade in the duchy. It also does not currently have a lord—a situation Wido Gall, ruler of Dulwich—is keen to remedy.
- 4. **Magic Items for Sale**: If you want to buy or sell magic items in Dulwich, the best place to go is Badger's. Bernhard "Badger" Ilmatoivia has contacts throughout the town and duchy and can generally find a buyer for any enchanted item. Those seeking a specific item can also engage the retired warrior to find it on their behalf.
- 5. **Plague**: The plague still savages the doomed village of Ashford. How anyone is still alive there, Darlen only knows. Something should be done about it. Militant folk call for the village to be burnt to the ground to contain the contagion.
- 6. **The Forest of Gray Spires**: The southern forests have long been a place of mystery and ruin. Ancient ruins lie scattered throughout the forest, ensuring a steady stream of

adventurers and explorers pass through Dulwich on their way south. An exploration into the forest's depths is only for the bravest and most skilled adventurers; there is little help to be found in the forest's depths.

# <span id="page-31-0"></span>5: NALTHRA' S J EWELLERY

Nalthra's Jewellery is location 5 on the Dulwich map.

This opulent three-storey tower shop is owned and operated by Nalthra Rekunen. The ground floor comprises a large showroom displaying exquisitely handcrafted jewellery, while the second floor serves as her workshop. Nalthra lives on the third floor.

Recently, lumber boss Ossi Karppanen (location 3) is the latest person to be utterly smitten by Nalthra, a fact she is pondering how to use to her advantage.

She promotes her business through her brother's inn (the Dancing Bear, location 4) and makes it known she is willing to buy gemstones. She might not always offer the best price, but she is consistent and can handle large purchases.

#### NALTHRA' S JEWELLERY BY DAY

By day, Nalthra's Jewellery trades like any other shop. It opens a few hours after dawn and closes around dusk. Rarely are there more than two or three customers in the showroom at once.

# NALTHRA' S JEWELLERY BY NIGHT

At night, Nalthra's Jewellery is closed. Nalthra lives on the third floor, and so the building is rarely unoccupied. People passing by will typically see lights in the third-floor windows until late.

# NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at Nalthra's Jewellery.

- **Nalthra Rekunen** (N middle-aged female half-elf **commoner**) embraces her elven heritage and the mystery it bestows, unlike her brother, Nurlon (landlord at the Dancing Bear Inn, location 4). She is Dulwich's most renowned, skilled and expensive jeweller, which is not surprising considering she has over a century of experience.
- **Lusia Ehtaro** (LN middle-aged female human **veteran**) serves Nalthra as the day guard, ostensibly. (Secretly, Lusia and Nalthra are a couple.) Lusia has worked here for almost seven years and is dependable and trustworthy. Lusia is perceptive and has an eye for dodgy customers. Normally, she only wears studded leather armour and carries her trusty longsword. If she expects trouble, however, she dons plate armour and shield.
- **Krog** (LN male half-orc **veteran**) serves Nalthra as an occasional night watchman. He does not work every night, rather coming in when Nalthra has particular need of his services. Krog is an insomniac and introvert. He likes his job.

# FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at Nalthra's Jewellery, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

1. **Lydia Shadewalker** (NE female halfling **spy**) plans to steal a few choice items from the showroom. She is here to sell some

- cheap pieces of jewellery so she can get a feel for the place. If the characters seem naive or inattentive, she marks them as potential targets.
- 2. **Stiina Keiho** (NG middle-aged female human **commoner**) shops here for a new necklace. She is the wife of a prominent local merchant, Uoti Keiho, and could be a useful contact. She is friendly toward obvious adventurers as she is fascinated by their exploits. If the characters are pleasant, she invites them to dinner to meet her husband.
- 3. **Tiera Kare** (NG young male human **commoner**) shops here for a ring for his beloved, Lyyti Jutikka. This teenager is madly in love but only has 4 gp to his name. As the characters arrive, he realises he can afford nothing here, and his shoulders slump in defeat.
- 4. **Miina Ampuja** (LG female human **priest** [Darlen]) wants to sell the proceeds of her last adventure to Nalthra to fund charitable works in Dulwich. However, she is not happy with the price Nalthra has offered and argues loudly. She believes she should get a better price because of her plans to help the needy and poor.
- 5. **Sipro Ihalempi** (NG male human **knight**) wants to buy the secret elvish magic rings he has heard Nalthra has for sale. Sipro is slow, simple and gullible. He won't take no for an answer, and if he suspects the characters are here to buy the same rings, he gets angry. Sipro is a big, burly fellow who doesn't realise how intimidating he can be. It doesn't help he's brought his beloved axe, *Head Hacker*, to the shop.
- 6. **Tahvana Janakka** (NE male human **spy**) enjoys conning people out of their gold by playing on their greed. He's got some "lovely" bracelets he's trying to sell. He thinks Nalthra is onto him, and so leaves with the characters. He tries to sell the trinkets to the group and complains Nalthra would not give him a fair price. Whip-thin, Tahvana looks like a stiff breeze could knock him over; he is, however, an excellent runner.

#### WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at Nalthra's Jewellery, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Showroom Empty**: The showroom is empty of other customers; the characters have the place to themselves.
- 2. **Showroom Closed**: Nalthra entertains an important wealthy client. Lusia (see "Notable Folk") stands outside the shop's main entrance to politely turn other customers away. She suggests they return in an hour.
- 3. **Showroom Busy**: The showroom is packed when the characters arrive, and Nalthra is rushed off her feet.
- 4. **Work in Progress**: Banging and thumping come from the upper floors. Nalthra has hired local artisans to make some improvements to her personal chambers.
- 5. **Singing Bard**: One of Nalthra's admirers has sent her a bard to sing of their devotions. As the bard bursts into song, Nalthra vainly tries to shut him up. The singer does not give up—an audience is an audience, after all.

6. **Angry Customer**: An angry man storms out of the shop as the characters arrive. He shouts something intelligible and then stomps off.

#### WHAT' S FO R SALE?

Along with her normal stock, Nalthra has certain unique and expensive items for sale.

- 1. **Golden Dragon Ring (750 gp)**: Wrought in the shape of a dragon eating its own tail, this chunky golden ring is superbly detailed. Nalthra has used tiny red rubies for the dragon's eyes. This ring is fine enough to be used in the crafting of a magic item.
- 2. **Silver Chain Necklace (500 gp)**: Of incredibly fine links, this slender, glimmering necklace is amazingly lightweight. An onyx pendant of a rearing black swan in profile hangs from the chain.
- 3. **Gold Armband (100 gp)**: Sized for a woman's slender arm, this finely wrought armband is about eight inches long. In places, the armband is worn as if it is very old.
- 4. **Platinum Brooch (400 gp)**: Shaped like a butterfly, this brooch is studded with tiny flecks of precious stones. Consequently, the butterfly's wings are a riot of colour.
- 5. **Golden Sun Amulet (200 gp)**: This Darlenite holy symbol once belonged to a wealthy woman dwelling in Languard. The family fell on hard times, and she had to sell the amulet. Nalthra puts no stock in rumours that the amulet is cursed…
- 6. **Jade Green Pendant (100 gp)**: This worn pendant hangs from a gold chain. The chain is much newer than the pendant. The pendant depicts an odd toad-like creature with three eyes and three mouths. It has an unwholesome look about it. The pendant is easily worth 300 gp, but Nalthra wants to get rid of it. (The toad is the symbol of Xeukros [CE demon lord of depravity, power and dominion over others], an ancient power worshipped in the Forests of Gray Spires.) Some degenerate elves still worship this fell power and would do much to retrieve the trinket.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Guards Needed**: Sometimes, Nalthra crafts particularly fine pieces of jewellery for those wishing to have them enchanted. Such customers include adventurers and members of the Sagacious Masters of the Eldritch Nexus dwelling in the Black Tower. Nalthra could hire the characters to transport a piece to such a customer.
- 2. **Showing a Kindness**: One of the characters realises Tiera Kare (#3 "Folk Out & About") is out of place here and clearly miserable. If a character finds out what is wrong and buys him a trinket for his beloved, that adventurer makes a friend for life. Tiera does not forget this kindness and could appear later to offer some minor but useful assistance.

- 3. **Nalthra Needs Cash**: Nalthra needs cash. This means she will offer a discount on her normal sale prices, but she won't buy anything at the moment.
- 4. **Nalthra Needs Stock**: Nalthra's stocks have run low. She isn't interested in dross or scrap metal but is interested in fine pieces of jewellery or gemstones the characters have for sale. She offers good prices for the right items.
- 5. **Stop, Thief**: In a moment of madness, Lydia Shadewalker (#1 "Folk Out & About" tried to filch a piece of jewellery. Nalthra noticed, and Lydia made a run for it. She dashes from the shop as the characters arrive.
- 6. **It's Raining**: It's raining heavily as the characters arrive at Nalthra's Jewellery. As they cross the street, four horsemen canter past and splatter them with mud. Nalthra is less than delighted to have such dirty and bedraggled customers in her fine shop.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Selling Your Loot**: If you have gems, jewellery or even precious scrap metal to sell, Nalthra's Jewellery is a good place to go. Nalthra is fair and honest.
- 2. **In Love with Nalthra**: Many local men are in love with Nalthra, although she ignores their interests. Some say she won't give her heart to a short-lived human. Others think she loves only her craft.
- 3. **Wealthy Beyond Imagining**: Nalthra has been plying her craft for decades. She is wealthy beyond the dreams of normal folk. Her shop is occasionally burgled, but no one has yet found her hidden wealth.
- 4. **Magic Rings**: Sometimes, Nalthra has magic rings for sale, which she gets from the elves that occasionally visit the town. She won't sell them to just anyone; you have to prove yourself to her.
- 5. **Ancient Peoples of the Woods**: Many inhuman civilisations have risen and fallen under the boughs of the southern woods. Ruins dot the forest, but the dangers are legion. The deeper into the woods you go, the more dangerous it gets.
- 6. **Nalthra is a Wizard**: Nalthra knows elven magic. She and her brother are much older than they appear and have extensively adventured in the southern woods.

# <span id="page-33-0"></span>6: TH E EAST GATE IN N

The East Gate Inn is location 6 on the Dulwich map.

The sprawling East Gate Inn caters to Dulwich's wealthy and wellto-do foreigners. Visiting nobles and merchants trade barbs while scheming against one another. Between the rich clientele and the dealings going on, it is the perfect place of employment for Almina Mastonen tavern maid and head of the infamous gang of burglars, the Black Cats. She's aided in her information-gathering endeavours by her best friend, the half-orc dishwasher, Holg Torntusk, who lets her ride around on his shoulders.

- **Food & Drink**: Meal (mutton stew or steak and mushroom pie; 5 sp), mug of good ale (1 sp), pitcher of good wine (3 sp).
- **Accommodation**: A standard room costs 2 gp a night. The room is richly appointed and features a stout, lockable door and shuttered windows.
- **Lifestyle**: Characters staying at the East Gate can enjoy a wealthy (4 gp/day) or aristocratic (10 gp/day) lifestyle.

The Black Cats keep several safe houses around Dulwich, thanks to their practice of sharing their ill-gotten wealth with the town's poor. Unfortunately, the Black Cats are being pressured by the more ruthless and violent Shadow Spiders (location 7) into giving them a cut of their profit. Currently, Almina has a few jobs lined up to steal important documents from rich merchants if she can get the right crew together.

# TH E EAST GATE IN N BY DAY

By day, the East Gate Inn is quiet, but visiting merchants sometimes use the taproom or one of the private dining rooms as a place to meet clients and partners. Thus, often, there is a muted hum of businesses about the place.

# TH E EAST GATE IN N BY NIGHT

After the day's work is done, many of Dulwich's wealthy and important residents come to the East Gate to see and be seen. Here, at night, is Dulwich's greatest concentration of wealth. The taproom is often busy but never reaches the raucous levels of carousing that some of Dulwich's lesser-quality, lower-class establishments attain.

# NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the East Gate Inn.

- **Almina Mastonen** (CN female halfling **spy**) leads the infamous gang of burglars, the Black Cats. At work in the tavern, she is friendly and cheery. When leading her gang, she is ruthless and focused. Because of her work at the East Gate, Almina often knows who will be where and when, allowing her to easily pick her gang's marks.
- **Holg Torntusk** (NG male half-orc **guard**) loves working at the East Gate. The inequity of the inn's customers' wealth

- compared to most of the townsfolk bothers him greatly. Thus, he enjoys helping his good friend, Almina, redistributing some of that wealth.
- **Hannu Mieho** (LN old male human **commoner**) owns the East Gate and loves rubbing shoulders with his rich and powerful customers. He does little actual work these days except greeting regulars. He is normally found perched at the end of the bar with a glass of wine in hand. Hannu is a useful contact for adventurers with a ready supply of disposable income or who fancy themselves as social climbers.

# FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the East Gate Inn, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Eleonora Himottu** (NG female human **noble**) visits Dulwich from Languard. She is discrete and will not say for whom she works but seeks business opportunities. She is dressed well, carries a small book in which she makes minute notes and is assisted by a suspiciously muscular and alert scribe.
- 2. **Elias Ikitiera** (LN male human **commoner**) searches for a magical item—an enchanted longsword—for his client, who is based in Dunstone. Elias is polite, intelligent and good at sniffing out a bargain. He has rooms at the inn; if his search is successful, he'll need to hire trustworthy guards to accompany him back to Dunstone.
- 3. **Konstantia Ilma** (LG female human **knight**) needs to find a wealthy patron. Konstantia has adventured for several years but now tires of the life; she thinks a stint as a bodyguard could be just the change she needs. Sadly, she has not yet met a client who fits her high moral standards. She is impeccably turned out, and her gear is in excellent condition. She'll linger here for another week or so before trying her luck in Languard.
- 4. **Anrra Jatrbek** (LG male dwarf **veteran**) visits Dulwich from a faraway dwarven hold. He has no goods for sale; this is a factfinding mission at the behest of this thane. Anrra is friendly but circumspect and not above getting humans drunk and then pumping them for information. He dresses well and has a warrior's bearing. He is uninterested in joining a group of adventurers unless they happen to be heading to Wellswood or interested in the fallen dwarven hold of Vongyth.
- 5. **Hanna Arpia** (LN female human **commoner**) comes from Languard with a supply of fine wines and cheeses for the wealthy. Hanna judges by appearances and does not waste her time with riff-raff. She is impeccably dressed but clearly enjoys her wares a little too much. She has no time for drunk, boorish adventurers.
- 6. **Aapro Kare** (NE male human **spy**) knows how to impersonate a wealthy merchant and is dressed impeccably to fill that role. He is knowledgable on a wide range of mercantile subjects he actually could make a good merchant—and abhors violence. He has dark, intelligent eyes, closely cropped brown hair and a cultivated accent.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the East Gate Inn, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Merchants**: Two well-dressed merchants sit at a table, sharing a bottle of wine while they negotiate a deal. Their bodyguards keep a watchful eye on each other and the other patrons.
- 2. **Busy Taproom**: The taproom is busy; many of Dulwich's wealthiest and most important folk are in tonight. There is precious little room for itinerant adventurers. If they have not dressed appropriately, they are somewhat ignored by the inn's clientele.
- 3. **Hannu at the Bar**: Hannu Mieho (see "Notable Folk") is sitting at the bar when the characters arrive. Unless he already knows them, he comes over and introduces himself. He is inquisitive and friendly.
- 4. **Aapro Hunts**: Aapro Kare (see "Notable Folk") sits in the bar watching for a gullible fool to rob. He does not target adventurers—he's not an idiot—but he might while away an hour or two with a character (particularly if they are paying for the drinks).
- 5. **Entertainment**: Hannu Mieho (see "Notable Folk") has arranged for a renowned bard, Kaiju Ilmatoivia (NG female half-elf **spy**), to entertain his customers. Word has got around, and the taproom is full.
- 6. **Heavy Rain**: Heavy rain falls outside, and the patrons that do make their way to the inn are soaked. There is much polite jockeying for positions close to the taproom's fireplace.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Defeat the Spiders**: Almina chaffs under the Shadow Spiders' demands and sees the characters as tools to upset the balance of power. She loudly complains while in their earshot of the Shadow Spiders and their violent, evil practices and then laments that no one has thus far been able to shut down their base of operations—the Golden Skull (location 7).
- 2. **Interested Almina**: Almina Mastonen (see "Notable Folk") takes an interest in the characters. Perhaps she decided they are easy marks, or—more likely—she decided the group could be useful pawns in her struggle against the Shadow Spiders.
- 3. **Thugs**: A gang of thugs hangs around outside the inn, drinking cheap ale and laughing. They do nothing overtly violent but act aggressively toward the inn's normal clients. These thugs are in the pay of the Shadow Spiders gang. Any overt display of force by the characters causes the thugs to disperse. They report the incident to the Shadow Spiders, however, which may cause the party problems in the future.
- 4. **Drunk Beggar**: A drunk beggar, Hintriikka Joutsimies (CN middle-aged male human **commoner**), staggers into the taproom and starts to harass the customers. Holg Torntusk (see "Notable Folk") politely but forcefully drags him outside.

- The incident causes a scene, and several of the well-to-do patrons are rather upset by the whole matter.
- 5. **Entertainment**: As #5 in "What's Going On?" But Kaiju Ilmatoivia is late. Could one of the characters fill in or find out where they have got to? If they investigate, they discover Kaiju has been attacked and robbed close to the inn. The muggers took her songbook, and she begs the characters to help her retrieve it.
- 6. **Arguing Merchants**: Two merchants argue over the terms of a deal. Neither wishes to compromise, and the argument slowly becomes loud and heated. Only the merchants' good manners prevent a brawl.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **East Gate is the Place**: If you want to rub shoulders with the rich and powerful in Dulwich, the East Gate Inn is the place to go. Watch out, though; the drinks are expensive, and the regulars will likely (politely) dismiss wandering adventurers and the like as "not the right sort".
- 2. **Tax the Rich**: Things are good in Dulwich, and its folk grow wealthy—particularly the merchants. Wido Gall is planning a new tax on the merchants, and they are not happy about it.
- 3. **The Shambling Dead**: Something is stirring in the cemetery (location 10). Visitors sometimes report being attacked by the animate dead! Almost no one voluntarily goes there after dark anymore.
- 4. **Selling Your Loot**: If you have gems, jewellery or even precious scrap metal to sell, Nalthra's Jewellery (location 5) is a good place to go. Nalthra is fair and honest. She is also an excellent jeweller—the best in town. Her brother, Nurlon Rekunen, owns the Dancing Bear (location 4).
- 5. **Badger's is Impenetrable**: Badger's (location 15) features a nigh-impregnable, hidden vault. It is one of the safest places in Dulwich. Money and valuables deposited there are safe—as long as you pay Badger's steep fee.
- 6. **Thieves' War**: Dulwich has no single pre-eminent thieves' guild. Rather, several small gangs vie for supremacy. This "shadow struggle" normally plays out quietly in Dulwich's alleyways at night, but signs are that the conflict is intensifying. Soon, perhaps, a winner will emerge. In the meantime, the monied classes would be well advised to keep out of the way and look to their own defences.

![](_page_34_Picture_25.jpeg)

# <span id="page-35-0"></span>7: TH E G OLDEN SKULL

The Golden Skull is location 7 on the Dulwich map.

The Golden Skull appears just like any other dingy, forgettable watering hole. Yet, at the rear, a concealed worn stair winds down to a secret basement carved out of the ancient ruins below Dulwich. Here, the town's largest and most ruthless thieves' gang, the Shadow Spiders, led by Voitto Markku, runs a gambling den and fighting pit. The pit's existence is a bit of an open secret in Dulwich society. Both the rich and the poor come to spectate, cheering on the bloody combatants.

- **Food & Drink**: Meal (parsnip and acorn stew or turnip pie; 1 sp) ale (4 cp), wine (pitcher; 1 sp).
- **Accommodation**: A standard room costs 2 sp a night. The room is draughty and has an easily defeated door lock. Visitors can sleep in the common room for 5 cp a night. In both places, a slumbering, inattentive newcomer is likely to be robbed blind.
- **Lifestyle**: Characters staying at the Golden Skull can enjoy a poor (2 sp/day) or modest (1gp/day) lifestyle.

# TH E GOLDEN SKULL BY DAY

For most of the day, the Golden Skull is quiet—many of its real clientele conduct their business at night. During the day, the taproom sees only sporadic, quiet business. The dingy taproom begins to get busy in the late afternoon.

# TH E GOLDEN SKULL BY NIGHT

At night, the Golden Skull comes alive. The taproom quickly fills with ne'er-do-wells preparing for or planning their nighttime nefarious doings. The Golden Skull's gambling den and fighting pit are often busy. In particular, gambling games are held here nightly—there is never any shortage of folk keen to win big. Fight nights are always busy.

# NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the Golden Skull.

- **Voitto Markku** (LE male human **spy**) craves money and power and will do anything to get both. Violence, murder and extortion are more than acceptable to Voitto, and his lack of morals, coupled with a total lack of empathy, makes him supremely dangerous. Stick-thin and pale of skin, Voitto has the appearance of one who does not often see the sun. He is always looking for pawns stymie the schemes of the town's other gangs.
- **Ottilia Jurva** (LE female human **bandit captain**) works at the Golden Skull behind the bar. She is tall and thin but blindingly fast. She wins her fights with guile and cunning, not with brute strength. She is murder incarnate with a dagger and much in demand for knife work.

#### TH E SHADOW SPIDERS

Voitto's money has brought the notoriously fickle and self-serving members of the Shadow Spiders to his side. In addition to gambling, the Shadow Spiders fence illegal goods and sell assassinations. Most of the smaller gangs offer the Shadow Spiders a cut of their profits—it's much safer that way.

#### FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the Golden Skull, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Silja Ilakka** (NE female human **assassin**) enthusiastically works with Voitto but harbours dark dreams of leading the Shadow Spiders one day (soon). She lingers in the taproom most evenings before slipping into the night to ply her trade. A surprising percentage of all murders in the town can be attributed to her work.
- 2. **Hilppa Aikio** (CE male human **bandit captain**) works as a thug for anyone who will pay him. Huge, muscled and bald Hilppa is used to his mere appearance ending most arguments or resistance. He loves a good fight, though, and often beats his victims if they refuse to fight him. Hilppa has no real friends. He works the door on fight night and knows many spectators (and all the regular fighters) by sight.
- 3. **Kuura Lempo** (NE male human **priest** [Braal]) visits the Golden Skull because she has heard "good things" about the folk who drink there. Of course, her definition of "good things" is probably wildly different to the characters. She keeps her religious beliefs to herself but is here looking for expendable hirelings; she plans to abduct a follower of Darlen and sacrifice them to her dark patron and needs some extra muscle.
- 4. **Lenokal Keenear** (NE male halfling spy) loves it when tall folk underestimate him. **Preternaturally** stealthy, he specialises in breaking into people's homes and businesses while they sleep. Once he has burgled the place, he always leaves a telltale sign of his presence. Lenokal is barely three feet tall, wears his dark brown hair closely cropped and doesn't bother with armour.
- 5. **Filpus** (N male human **commoner**) drinks deeply. A beggar, he was given a gold coin today! He is drunk, obnoxious and on the way to getting a beating. If he really annoys a regular customer or gang member, he might find himself in the fighting pit below the tavern.
- 6. **Ovdris Boferg** (LG female dwarf **veteran**) drinks at the Golden Skull while she looks for a friend, Delkas Urzak, who disappeared during a night out a week ago. She leans on the bar alone, quietly drinking. The regulars have not yet decided if she is an easy mark or not; thus, they have left her alone—for now. If the characters are obviously out of place, Ovdris approaches them and asks if they have seen her friend. She is stocky, black-haired and clad in a supple chain shirt. She carries two well-used handaxes at her belt.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Golden Skull, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Quiet**: The taproom is quiet, and the characters—likely new to the inn—stand out like sore thumbs. As word gets around that potential marks are at the tavern, a steady trickle of thieves, pickpockets and muggers arrive to take the newcomers' measure. The characters are likely followed—by more than one group—when they leave.
- 2. **Sinister Types**: Several small groups of obviously nefarious individuals linger in the common room but at widely dispersed tables. Each group mutters to themselves—perhaps planning their next crimes.
- 3. **Busy Taproom**: The taproom is thick with rogues, pick pockets and street toughs. The characters cannot find a table. They are likely jostled as they move through the taproom—if they are drunk or distracted, a thief may even try to lift a few coins from their pouch.
- 4. **Gambling Games**: Several low-stakes gambling games are going on in the common room. Surprisingly, most of the participants are not cheating—there is some honour among thieves, after all. If the characters join a game, however, everyone tries to cheat them.
- 5. **Delivery**: The Golden Skull is taking in a delivery of wines and ale. The delivery wasn't actually meant for the tavern; the wagon was taken on the road just outside town. Voitto Markku (see "Notable Folk") is in a rare good mood, and his attitude is infectious; the regulars are a merry bunch this evening.
- 6. **Murder**: A short brawl has just finished. The brawl was cover for the settling of a score. One of the brawlers lies under a table with three knives in his back.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **New Spiders**: Voitto (see "Notable Folk") is always open to new recruits either for the Shadow Spiders or the fighting pit. He is also on the look out for brave (and gullible) adventurers to subdue dangerous wild beasts for his fighting pit.
- 2. **Want to Win Some Goal?**: A regular thinks one of the characters is particularly gullible and invites them to a game in the inn's cellar; it's a secret game, though, so they mustn't tell anyone else.
- 3. **Gullible Pawns**: Voitto (see "Notable Folk") is always looking for gullible pawns he can use to stymie his rivals' plans. At the moment, he seeks to hurt or injure Almina Mastonen at the East Gate Inn (location 6).
- 4. **Busy and Dangerous Taproom**: The taproom is thick with rogues, pickpockets and street toughs. The characters cannot find a table and are likely jostled as they move through the taproom and are given some hard looks by many of the regulars. If the characters seem drunk, weak, distracted or gullible when they leave, they are likely followed by more

- than one group of rogues set on relieving them of their burdensome wealth.
- 5. **Black Cat Agent**: A member of the Black Cats gang, Kauko Otava (NE male human **spy**), has come here to spy on the Shadow Spiders. The Black Cats are based in the East Gate Inn (location 6). If the characters seem wildly out of place, Kauko approaches them and, after a short bout of pleasantries, suggests they might prefer that inn. If this fails, he warns them that the Golden Skull is the base of the notoriously evil and depraved Shadow Spiders. He hopes that after this pronouncement, the characters' adventurous spirits will assert themselves.
- 6. **Ill-Advised Merchant**: Kaisu Neuvo (N male human **noble**) has a problem with a rival and has come here to hire someone to do something about it. Now that she is here, she has realised she has made a terrible mistake and that she'll be lucky to leave with this life. At sight of the characters, she latches onto the group.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Gambling Den**: The Golden Skull hides a gambling den in a secret cellar far below the inn. The cellar hosts nightly games; much silver and gold have been won and lost at the Golden Skull's tables. Not everyone survives the games.
- 2. **Fighting Pit**: One of Dulwich's open secrets is the existence of a fighting pit below the Golden Skull in a cellar carved from the ancient ruins lying beneath the town. The weekly fight nights are well attended by all types of folk Sometimes, Voitto secures dangerous wild beasts for the fights!
- 3. **Thieves at War**: Dulwich's various criminal gangs are at war struggling for supremacy over the underworld. Thus far, the gangs have concentrated on each other; when one emerges victorious, a new wave of crime will sweep over the town.
- 4. **Tax the Rich**: Things are good in Dulwich, and its folk grow wealthy—particularly the merchants. Wido Gall is planning a new tax on the merchants, and they are not happy about it.
- 5. **The Shambling Dead**: Something is stirring in the cemetery (location 10). Visitors sometimes report being attacked by the animate dead! Almost no one voluntarily goes there after dark anymore—particularly on the nights of the new moon. Pickings have been slim in the cemetery of late.
- 6. **Olden Ruins**: Dulwich is not the first settlement to stand at the site. The ancient ruin of an elder settlement lies beneath the town. Sometimes, adventurers brave these ruins; not all of them emerge.

![](_page_36_Picture_25.jpeg)

# <span id="page-37-0"></span>8: ERONEN' S SAFE TRAVELS

Eronen's Safe Travels is location 8 on the Dulwich map.

This long two-storey stone and wood building looks out over the street, a sign depicting a pair of booted feet over its stout wooden door. The former adventurer, Henni Eronen, runs this general supply store catering to travellers. In addition to basic adventuring supplies, Henni keeps a few specialist items behind the counter. Henni also supplies local guides specialising in travel through the Salt Mire and the Forest of Gray Spires.

Eronen's Safe Travels has a good reputation throughout Dulwich; Henni is mostly thought of as fair and honest. However, rumours have begun to grow that she is in some way connected with the bandits lurking in the nearby woodlands. Certainly, a good proportion of her customers report encounters with bandits, but then again, they are travellers, and such is to be expected.

# ERONEN' S SAFE TRAVELS BY DAY

Eronen's Safe Travels is open most days. The shop opens early many travellers want to make the most of a day—and closes before dusk. The shop is quieter in the winter when fewer travellers plan major trips into the interior but does a roaring trade in the spring and summer.

# ERONEN' S SAFE TRAVELS BY NIGHT

Eronen's Safe Travels is closed at night except for valued customers who may be able to get Eronen to stay open late. For an hour or so after dusk, Henni and her staff tidy up, restock shelves and so on.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at Eronen's Safe Travels.

- **Henni Eronen** (CG female human **scout**) enthusiastically greets customers to her "humble establishment". Previously, some customers have misinterpreted her friendliness as a romantic interest, which baffles her. With pale blue eyes and mousy blond hair, however, Henni is an attractive woman. She needs no partner, though, even though she has lost her left arm, enjoys living on her own, and resents any suggestion that she might need help.
- **Elsa Nousia** (NG female human **commoner**) works with Henni and enjoys meeting the eclectic bunch of people visiting the shop. She is friendly and supremely knowledgeable about gear. If anything, she is chatty and being served by Elsa can take a surprisingly long time.
- **Reiju Miela** (N male human **commoner**) deals with all the boring mundanities of the business and is a stickler for detail. He does everything Henni can't be bothered to do. He doesn't interact with customers much—he's normally in the back—and is not wildly keen on adventurers. He thinks they are coarse, loud folk with little regard for the proper way—his way—of doing things. In the main, he is right.

# FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at Eronen's Safe Travels, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Tapani Arpia** (LN male human **commoner**) visits Eronen's Safe Travels before every trip. Tapani is a roving merchant who goes where business takes him. With his wagon and small team of assistants, servants and guards, he is a familiar sight throughout Ashlar. Tapani is worried about the reports of increasing bandit activity in Dulwich's environs. Tapani is friendly and happy to share the road with heavily armed adventurers of good reputation.
- 2. **Pentti Kontio** (NE male human **bandit captain**) stops in once a month to see Eronen and to shoot the breeze. Pentti presents himself as a local guide eager for new customers. However, he is actually a spy for a bandit gang lurking nearby. Sometimes, he actually guides groups—normally those too numerous or well-armed for his friends—while other times, he leads his charges into traps. He avoids guiding adventurers at all costs and comes up with all manner of inventive excuses as to why he cannot help the characters.
- 3. **Rieti Kurikka** (N middle-aged male human **acolyte** [Behron]) visits the shop to learn about the conditions on the local roads. He is a good friend of Henni's, and the two often share a drink or two. Rieti has a good store of news and knows Ashlar's roads and trails well. This bearded, middle-aged man makes an excellent travelling companion. He is a fine cook, knows many songs and is a friendly, talkative sort.
- 4. **Ilta Rautia** (NG female human **scout**) hangs around the shop waiting for customers. She works as a guide and knows the southern woods well. She is a good archer and a dependable guide. Ilta is friendly but does not speak much. Her gear is plain and serviceable, and she has the look of the wilderness about her. She will happily guide adventurers through the woods for 1 gp a day, but she won't engage in actual adventure—she's not desperate to die.
- 5. **Martta Otava** (CG female human **spy**) gears up for her first adventure. She's got a hankering to explore the southern woods and has a romantic ideal of adventuring far divorced from the reality of the life. She waxes lyrical about her plans and dreams to anyone who will listen; she attempts to attach herself to the characters' group. It is obvious to all but the most neophyte adventurer that Martta is doomed unless someone takes her under their wing.
- 6. **Tiera Vartia** (LG male human **scout**) visits the shop every week or so to see if Henni knows of any work for him. Tiera is the most skilled and highly regarded guide in Dulwich when it comes to exploring the southern woods and the Gray Spires. He is honourable and dependable. He is brave and does all he can to keep his charges safe. He charges 3 gp a day for his services but is reputed to have never gotten lost and, more importantly, never lost a client to the wood's denizens.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at Eronen's Safe Travels, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Busy**: Several other groups of travellers are at the shop stocking up on provisions and gear. The shop is busy, and the characters must wait to be served.
- 2. **Wagons Outside**: A merchant has stopped in to provision their caravan, and two wagons watched over by four bored guards stand outside the shop. The merchant is inside—and spending well!
- 3. **Tiera Available**: **Tiera Vartia** (see "Folk Out & About") is in the shop to chat with Henni. If he overhears the characters discussing a trip into the southern woods, he introduces himself and offers his services. If the characters seem unsure about employing him, Henni provides him with a glowing recommendation.
- 4. **Delivery**: Henni is overseeing a large delivery of stock from Languard. Workers sweat as they unload many boxes, barrels and crates from a pair of wagons.
- 5. **Aimless Browsing**: Several customers listlessly browse the shop as the characters arrive. (They could be nothing more than normal customers, or they could be thieves, lone adventurers and so on).
- 6. **Thief**: A thief has just grabbed several items and dashed out of the door. In fact, a character may have spotted the running thief as they approached the shop. This could be nothing more than a random occurrence or could lead the characters into conflict with one of the town's many criminal gangs.

# OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Mercenary Guards**: Henri is always willing to give fellow adventurers a bit of advice or help them get jobs guarding caravans or serving as wilderness guides. She has many contacts with Dulwich's merchants and can arrange a meeting between one such person and the characters if they seem honest and reliable.
- 2. **Henni, Befriended**: If befriended, Henni tells the story of how she lost her arm to an ice-wreathed skeleton in the deep crypts below Valentin's Folly. She shudders at the memory of it and tries to dissuade the characters from exploring the place. She knows the keep's precise location, though, and can be convinced to give the characters directions.
- 3. **Map For Sale (25 gp)**: Henni sometimes copies some of her old travel maps out and offers them for sale. This map shows all of Ashlar's towns and villages and shows all the major back trails and paths between them. The map is not exactly beautiful, but it is accurate.
- 4. **Sipri Needs Money**: Sipri Uro (NG male human **veteran**) needs to raise money for his next expedition. He is here trying to swap a *+1 dagger* for all the supplies he and his companions need. If the characters express an interest in the

- weapon, he is more than happy to sell it to them at only threequarters of normal market value.
- 5. **Loitering Thief**: Lotta Valta (CN female human **spy**) has just slipped something small into her pouch while she casually browses the shop. A perceptive character spots what she is doing; she steals several more items before sauntering out.
- 6. **Wagon for Sale**: Henni has an old wagon for sale (for 20 gp), sold to her by a retiring merchant. Unbeknownst to her, the wagon has a secret storage compartment—the previous owner was a smuggler. About a week after the characters buy the wagon, the old smuggler remembers they left something valuable in the hidden compartment and starts to track down the new owners.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Bandits**: Increasing numbers of bandits have been seen upon the fringes of the southern woods, and wise merchants are recruiting extra guards to protect their caravans. Opportunities abound for those skilled with a blade or magic.
- 2. **Longbridge in Crisis**: The political turmoil in Longbridge shows no signs of subsiding. The village has no lord, and several powerful folks are making moves—it seems—to become its lord.
- 3. **Easy Work**: If you are looking for easy work, Henni at Eronen's Safe Travels always seems to know of merchants looking for reliable guards.
- 4. **Eronen Works With Bandits**: Eronen works with the bandits lurking in the southern woods and feeds them details about travelling merchants and the like. While she seems like a good person, this one-armed shopkeeper is not a retired adventurer as she claims but rather a bandit forced into semihonest work by her crippling injury!
- 5. **Magic Items for Sale**: If you want to buy or sell magic items in Dulwich, the best place to go is Badger's. Bernhard "Badger" Ilmatoivia has contacts throughout the town and duchy and can generally find a buyer for any enchanted item. Those seeking a specific item can also engage the retired warrior to find it on their behalf.
- 6. **The Forest of Gray Spires**: The southern forests have long been a place of mystery and ruin. Ancient ruins lie scattered throughout the forest, ensuring a steady stream of adventurers and explorers pass through Dulwich on their way south. If you seek to head south, you can always find a guide at Eronen's Safe Travels.

# <span id="page-39-0"></span>9: SAINI ALANEN' S HOUSE

Saini Alanen's House is location 9 on the Dulwich map.

This stone-towered, three-storey house is home to Dulwich's renowned sage, Saini Alanen. Saini receives money from the town by making her large library on the first floor open to the public. The tower is where she spends most of her time in private research, mostly studying local ancient history, which she finds endlessly fascinating.

# SAINI ALANEN' S HOUSE BY DAY

Saini Alanen receives a trickle of visitors during the day. Most visitors come here to consult her library for a variety of personal reasons, while a few engage her services to ferret out more esoteric or specialised facts and information. She is normally at home during the day, engaged in her own research if she is not working for a patron.

# SAINI ALANEN' S HOUSE BY NIGHT

Saini normally shuts her library at dusk, although she can keep it open if necessary. In the evenings, she often goes out to see friends or hosts gatherings of like-minded folk at the library. Such gatherings often run late as attendees share the fruits of their labours and research.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at Saini Alanen's House.

- **Saini Alanen** (NG female human wizard 4) finds history endlessly fascinating. She loves nothing more than finding a new diary, travelogue or sheaf of maps. She also delights in speaking with "old-timers" and non-humans with long lifespans, such as dwarves or elves. Clearly possessed of prodigious intellect, Saini is one of the cleverest, most educated folk in Dulwich. She wears modest robes of red velvet and is always neatly turned out—as befits her role as Dulwich's librarian.
- **Taavi Vesivalo** (N young male human **commoner**) harbours feelings for Saini Alanen and is often here during the day "reading" while mooning over the object of his affections. The young, dark-haired man is clever and talkative except in the presence of Saini when he is struck near mute with nerves.
- **Inkeri Niera** (NG female human **commoner**) helps out at the library and would love to learn how to cast spells—magic fascinates her, and she often hints (unsubtly) to Saini that she would love to apprentice to her. She is intelligent, bookish, loves reading and has an agile, hungry mind. Inkeri dresses well; she is the indulged elder daughter of a local merchant and wears several fine pieces of jewellery, including two gold rings and an interesting, elegant butterfly-shaped silver brooch of outlandish design.

#### FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at Saini Alanen's House, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Sippo Koira** (LN old male human **commoner**) visits Dulwich from Languard to carry out genealogical research for a patron. Sippo is a genial old man whose job—in this instance bores him. He is taking his time and not working very hard. He wears a red robe with slightly frayed cuffs and carries a satchel full of scrolls, documents and notes. He is happy to chat with the characters—perhaps they have a more interesting (and better paid) job.
- 2. **Teppana Vaania** (N male human **veteran**) possesses an old map of the Forest of Gray Spires and is negotiating with Saini to sell it to her. He is canny and well knows the value of this map—particularly as it shows several intriguing features that Saini has no real knowledge about. Teppana is a ruddycheeked, robust-looking chap who still wears the mud of the trail upon his clothes. Once he's sold the map, he'll be off to the nearest tavern.
- 3. **Kaisa Miela** (LG female human **acolyte** [Darlen]) sits at a desk intent on an old book detailing the foundation of Dulwich in the years following Ashlar's establishment. She is intrigued by references to the town being settled upon the "bones of the ancients". Kaisa has short brown hair and a slender, almost frail build. She suffered a terrible wasting disease as a child, and her constitution is not robust.
- 4. **Panu Otava** (NG male human **scout**) want to explore the Salt Marsh but doesn't want to do it alone. He knows there is strength in numbers and many dangers lurk in the fetid mire. He also knows adventurers often visit Saini for information and maps and is hanging around waiting for a suitable group. He looks a little bit ill at ease in the library. Panu is tall, muscular and thin. His long black hair tumbles over his shoulders, and he has the look of the wild about him.
- 5. **Immo Tuntia** (NE male human **spy**) plots a theft in the better part of town and has come here in search of maps of the town as it was centuries ago. He knows of the old settlement buried beneath Dulwich and is planning to come at his target from beneath. Thus, he is searching for a map of the old town. He has disguised himself for this visit as a wealthy merchant from Languard, and his cover story is that he is searching for a good place to establish a new business. His story has many holes and won't stand up to detailed scrutiny. Immo is clever but not as clever as he thinks he is.
- 6. **Yaama Wynlen** (CG female elf **acolyte**) peruses the library out of boredom rather than with any particular goal and has become a regular fixture here of late. If engaged in conversation, this pale-skinned, dark-haired elf explains she is in town waiting for friends to arrive but explains no further. She values her privacy. If she senses kindred spirits in the party, she may join them for a brief foray into the surrounding wilderness, but she does not make friends easily.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at Saini Alanen's House, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Library Closed**: This is one of the rare occasions when the library is closed during the day; Saini Alanen has important business elsewhere in town.
- 2. **Library Busy**: The library chamber is not particularly large, and it gets busy when more than six people are perusing the books therein; this is one of those days and Saini regretfully asks the characters to return tomorrow.
- 3. **Saini Busy**: Saini Alanen is busy helping another visitor when the characters arrive. She is happy to chat with them, but they must wait their turn. It takes hours to extricate herself from her prior client—a boring man who thinks himself fascinating and a bit of a ladies' man.
- 4. **Argument**: Two visitors both want to study the same book at the same time. They are engaged in a quiet but ongoing dispute over who gets it first. It transpires they are researching the same subject but for different clients who both claim ownership of a piece of land just outside the town.
- 5. **Want an Apprentice?**: Inkeri Niera (see "Notable Folk") is at the library. If she realises one of the characters is a wizard, she approaches them to subtly and then unsubtly find out if they want an apprentice.
- 6. **Bored Reader**: One other person is in the library (roll on "Folk Out & About"). That person is bored or taking a break from their studies; they strike up a conversation with the characters.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Fallen Vongyth**: Saini has become fascinated with the stories of fallen Vongyth—a dwarven hold that lies somewhere to the south, and would love to learn more about it. She offers to buy any maps, journals or artefacts to do with the place from the party.
- 2. **New Maps**: Saini is eager to hear tales from explorers venturing into the local ruins and pays handsomely for welldetailed maps of new locales.
- 3. **Bring Me Lost Lore**: Saini occasionally hires adventurers to poke about forgotten places for lost lore and historical artifacts. She is particularly interested in adding old books, scrolls and maps to her collection.
- 4. **Saini Alanen Available**: Saini is between patrons and is available for immediate consulting work. She is also bored and keen to get her teeth into an interesting problem. Additionally, she is also available for spellcasting services.
- 5. **Library Burgled**: Someone broke into the library last night and stole a rare book. Saini wants the book returned and would be grateful to anyone retrieving it.
- 6. **Secret Panel Found**: Saini was reorganising some shelves when she found a secret compartment hidden behind one. She is examining it when the party arrives.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Brainy Saini**: Saini Alanen is one of Dulwich's cleverest and most knowledgeable people. If you want to know something about the town's history or the surrounding area, Saini will almost certainly know the answer (or she can find the answer for a price).
- 2. **Saini is a Wizard**: Saini Alanen is a wizard, and she has a special collection of books not normally available for public viewing. Such books are kept in her private study and number several spellbooks as well as a few rare books of troublesome origin and subject matter.
- 3. **Bandits**: Bandits are active in the southern woods again. The town authorities are offering rewards for bandits delivered alive to Castle Dulwich. Such folk will be made a public (and gruesome) example of.
- 4. **Gray Spires of Mystery**: The Forest of Gray Spires is a strange place laden with the legendry and ruin of many forgotten, fallen civilisations.
- 5. **Political Doings**: Wido Gall, ruler of Dulwich, has designs on the lordless village of Longbridge.
- 6. **The Shadowed Keep**: An old keep lies in the woodlands to the south of Dulwich. Once home to Valentin Ironwolf, the place is now a ruin. What foul things lurk within?

#### THINGS FO R SALE

Some or all of the items below are for sale from Saini Alanen.

- 1. **Old Map (50 gp)**: This old map dated 200 years ago shows several small settlements set in the fringes of the Salt Mire and the southern forests. The settlements no longer exist and could be locales for minor adventures.
- 2. **Scroll Crafting (var.)**: Saini Alanen has a small supply of scrolls and ink suitable for spell scroll crafting; for the requisite amount of gold, she could scribe such scrolls as the characters require.
- 3. **Spell Swaps (var.)**: Saini is always keen to swap spells with a fellow wizard. Alternatively, if the price is right, she might let a character copy a spell from her spellbook.
- 4. **Research (5 gp/day)**: Saini is available to carry out research on behalf of paying clients. The base cost is 5 gp a day, but if she has to travel, purchase additional books or materials and so on, the client must also meet these expenses. She only travels out of town for matters of great import (or for wealthy or powerful clients).
- 5. **Scroll of Web (250 gp)**: Saini Alanen has a *scroll of web* she does not need. She is happy to sell it or swap it if the characters have something she wants, such as a 2nd-level or higher divination spell on a scroll.
- 6. **Spare Room (7 gp/week)**: Saini has a spare room in her chambers above the library. She fancies some like-minded company in the evenings and offers the room, on the basis of accommodation only, to sages, wizards and the like.

# <span id="page-41-0"></span>10: CEMETERY AND CATACOMBS

Dulwich Cemetery is part of location 10 on the Dulwich map.

The Dulwich cemetery lies (appropriately) adjacent to the Lawgiver's Hall (location 2). Large mausoleums belonging to the wealthy dot the cemetery.

The earthly remains of common citizens are interred below the cemetery in the catacombs built upon the ruins of an elder settlement. The clergy at the Lawgiver's Hall only maintains one section of the rambling catacombs; numerous tunnels branch out like a hive, burrowing ever deeper into the ancient ruins below. People exploring these tunnels often disappear. As of late, the mad dwarf cleric, Orkus Drakar, has made a section of the ancient, benighted ruins his home.

# DULWICH CEMETERY BY DAY

Except during a burial service, the cemetery is rarely busy. Normally, a few townsfolk are here to pay their respects to their dearly (or not so dearly) departed friends and relatives. Other visitors—illicit lovers, those engaged in secret negotiations, and so on—come here because the mostly empty cemetery is a good place for a private colloquy.

# DULWICH CEMETERY BY NIGHT

At night, deep shadows fill the cemetery, and few people visit the place. Those that do are almost universally up to no good. However, even such ne'er-do-wells have begun to shun the cemetery—finding somewhere else to meet; reports of animate dead wandering the place, a strange half-glimpsed capering, gibbering figure and several missing folk conspire to keep them out of Dulwich Cemetery.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the cemetery.

- **Orkus Drakar** (CE male dwarf **priest** [Braal]) went mad during an adventure deep in Gloamhold's benighted depths. Consequently, Orkus turned to Braal's worship. Thoroughly insane, he enjoys animating the corpses in the cemetery and letting them shamble amok. To him, it's harmless fun and a diversion while he waits for further, more destructive visions from his god. Orkus's insanity is deep and incurable.
- **Jaakkima Aikio** (N old male human **commoner**) serves as the cemetery's senior caretaker. Still spritely for his advanced age, Jaakkima has worked at the cemetery for decades. He has seen much in his time—grave robbers, want-to-be necromancers and more—but the recent reports of undead wandering the cemetery have shaken him. He provides any help he can to characters offering to investigate the undead and put a stop to their nightly wanderings.

# FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the cemetery, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Issu Kaivas** (LN male human **veteran**) serves as a bodyguard to a rich merchant, Martti Leino. The merchant has come to pay his respects to his dead wife, and Issu waits outside while Martti prays in the family mausoleum. Issu is bored and happy to chat with the characters—but keeps an alert eye out for danger and one hand on his sword hilt.
- 2. **Jaakko Ikuturso** (CE male human **spy**) plans to break into one of the mausoleums and relieve the occupants of the jewellery and other finery they no longer need. Perceptive characters may sense this trim, well-dressed man is up to no good. Jaakko spins a good tale and lies freely to deflect the characters' suspicions. He's heard about the undead sometimes encountered at night in the cemetery and uses this story to his advantage; he knows it is bound to pique the adventurers' interest.
- 3. **Tuulitar Kallas** (LG female human **acolyte** [Darlen]) visits the cemetery out of a vague sense of unease. She is from Languard and is on a tour of the duchy. Last night, she had a strange dream wherein she saw a distinctive mausoleum squatting under an ominous black cloud. She is trying to find the mausoleum as she believes the dream was a warning from her divine patron. She is prim, proper, energetic and full of the desire to do good.
- 4. **Saara Nousia** (NG female human **commoner**) searches for her friend, Ulla Päivö, who has been missing for a couple of days. Ulla liked to come to the cemetery for some peace and quiet, and Saara has looked everywhere else for her. Saara is plain-looking and plainly spoken and believes in the intrinsic goodness of folk; she asks the characters for help.
- 5. **Pekka Kurikka** (CE male human **mage**) searches for a particular mausoleum which he believes contains the remains of a powerful wizard of old. In truth, he cares little about the wizard's remains; he wants the items said to be buried with him. Pekka apes the appearance and demeanour of a minor merchant. If pressed, his story is that he is planning to build a mausoleum of his own, and he's just looking around. Pekka sometimes haunts the cemetery at night and has seen some of the minor undead shambling about; he has a pretty good idea what is going on but has no intention of doing anything about it as long as they don't get in the way of his searches.
- 6. **Saphiella Bistaroron** (CG female elf **knight**) visits the cemetery because the way humans bury their dead is so different to her people's practises. Saphiella is entranced by the architecture and gloomy feel of the place. She's keen to visit the catacombs as well but thus far has not secured permission—the clergy at the Lawgiver's Hall take a dim view of folk wandering about down there for no apparent good reason. She is talkative and friendly and fascinated by other people's cultures.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the cemetery, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Mourner**: The characters spy a mourner standing in front of a mausoleum. (Roll on "Folk Out & About"). The person is drinking from a small bottle of brandy and could be just exploring the cemetery, toasting a deceased loved one or doing something else entirely.
- 2. **Mausoleum Maintenance**: Two stonemasons are repairing a mausoleum; recently, some of the structure's decorations have been vandalised, and the family wish them restored to their former glory.
- 3. **Illicit Lovers**: Two young lovers have met to escape their families' prying eyes. They have found a secluded spot to spend some time together. They are oblivious to anything but each other.
- 4. **Jaakkima Works**: Jaakkima Aikio (see "Notable Folk") is pruning a tree whose branches have grown too close to a mausoleum. He is happy to stop and chat; he's not as young as he used to be, and the work is hard. A character lending him a hand learns one rumour from "Whispers & Rumours".
- 5. **Reading the Old Map**: Pekka Kurikka (see "Folk Out & About") is consulting a scroll and is oblivious to the characters' presence. A perceptive character spots the scroll is an old, worn map of the cemetery before Pekka notices them and puts it away. He is flustered for a moment before he slips into his assumed persona as a merchant and remembers his cover story.
- 6. **Elegy for the Dead**: A professional mourner, Sikke Vasara (N female human **commoner**), dressed in funerary robes, stands before a mausoleum earning her wage. She is reciting a lengthy elegy from a scroll. Once she has finished, she is happy to chat with the characters. Sikke is at the cemetery several times a week—but never after dark—and is aware of the various rumours circulating about the place.

# OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Funeral Service**: Someone rich has died, and the family are interring them in the ancestral vault. A score of people are present—and could serve as witnesses if the characters are engaged in questionable behaviour.
- 2. **Concerned High Priestess**: High priestess Vuokko Laiten (location 2) is concerned about the odd happenings at the cemetery and could hire trustworthy adventurers to investigate. If the characters seem to be such folk, she approaches them.
- 3. **Zombie!**: A shuffling sound and moaning coming from behind a mausoleum herald the arrival of a **zombie**. The zombie wears the clothes of a rich person who has not long been interred.

- 4. **Cemetery Empty**: The characters are the only people in this part of the cemetery; there are no witnesses to anything they might get up to.
- 5. **Odd Sounds**: Strange, muffled sounds emanate from within an old ornate mausoleum surrounded by a low stone wall. The ground around the mausoleum is overgrown with sickly weeds and small, strangely coloured wildflowers.
- 6. **Cemetery Busy**: Through happenstance, the cemetery is relatively busy with mourners and the like. If the characters seek rumours or gossip, they can easily find them here. Unfortunately, this also means there are many potential witnesses to whatever they are planning to do.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Something's Going On**: Strange sounds and smells have sometimes been reported in the cemetery. Something is going on, but no one important seems to care—or are they covering something up?
- 2. **The Shambling Dead**: Something is stirring in the cemetery. Visitors sometimes report being attacked by the animate dead! Almost no one now voluntarily goes there after dark. Most of the attacks occur on nights when a new moon hangs in the night sky.
- 3. **Infested Catacombs**: Occasionally, the town pays for adventurers to clear out certain areas of the catacombs and ancient ruins below them. Only trusted adventurers are asked to perform such tasks. The catacombs are normally accessed from the Lawgiver's Hall (location 2), but rumours speak of other hidden entrances.
- 4. **High Priestess Doubted**: Vuokko Laiten (LN female human **priest** [Conn]; location 2) is the new, young high priestess of Conn in Dulwich. Many people don't believe she is wise and experienced enough to navigate the town's tricky political landscape. Few people expect her to hold her position long. Several of the clergy are thought to be jockeying for her position; not even the priesthood is immune from the political machinations engulfing the town!
- 5. **Thieves' War**: Dulwich has no single thieves' guild. Rather, several small gangs vie for supremacy. This "shadow struggle" normally plays out quietly in Dulwich's alleyways at night, but signs are that the conflict is intensifying. Soon, perhaps, a winner will emerge. In the meantime, the common folk would be well advised to keep out of the way.
- 6. **Dangers Abound**: Many dangers press in on Dulwich and its folk. Rumours speak of bandits in the southern woods, unrest and potential for war at the village of Longbridge and other darker things stirring in the otherworldly Forest of Gray Spires. And, to cap it all, the merchant class is getting restless and seeking more power—something Dulwich's lord, Wido Gall, is certain to stamp out at some point. Dulwich's common folk need stout adventurers of good heart to keep them safe!

#### <span id="page-43-0"></span>11: DULWICH MARKETPLACE

Dulwich Marketplace is location 11 on the Dulwich map.

Dulwich hosts an open market in the north-western section of town. Numerous small stalls and booths sell everything from produce, cloth and even a selection of weapons and armour. Various guilds also have small stalls set up to sell their most sought-after wares.

Use this table to determine what a stall sells:

| D20 | STALL SELLS          | D20 | STALL SELLS            |
|-----|----------------------|-----|------------------------|
| 1   | Bric-a-brac          | 11  | Pots, pans and so on   |
| 2   | Fruit and vegetables | 12  | Belts, boots & shoes   |
| 3   | Bread                | 13  | Jewellery              |
| 4   | Ale and beer         | 14  | Furniture,<br>woodwork |
| 5   | Clothes, mundane     | 15  | Simple weapons         |
| 6   | Clothes, woollen     | 16  | Pets                   |
| 7   | Iron ware goods      | 17  | Clothes, woollen       |
| 8   | Small livestock      | 18  | Meat                   |
| 9   | Simple toys          | 19  | Fortune telling        |
| 10  | Candles              | 20  | Bric-a-Brac            |

In addition, loud snd garish street performers compete for shoppers' attention (and coin). (Pick pockets hang around such folk in surprising numbers.)The most famous of these is the mysterious Zado (see "Notable Folk"). Other traders wander the market either carrying their few wares or pushing them about in handcarts. Refreshments can also be had from several handcarts and stalls

#### DULWICH MARKETPLACE BY DAY

By day, Dulwich Marketplace is a busy place. Some local artificers and trade folk have permanent stalls while others are taken by visiting merchants, folk visiting from nearby villages, and others just trying to sell their junk and tat. Villagers and visitors to the town come here to buy that which they cannot get at home.

#### DULWICH MARKETPLACE BY NIGHT

At night, the marketplace is quiet—but far from empty. Some stallholders employ folk to watch their merchandise overnight so they don't have to pack it all away and keep it safe from the roaming beggars, thieves and drunks that infest the place after dark. A few stalls—fortunetellers and the like—stay open late, while others use the unoccupied tents and stalls as places for their trysts or secret colloquies.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at Dulwich Marketplace.

• Zado (N male human unknown) is a strange individual dressed in black who wears various feathered masks while juggling and doing magical tricks. Zado hears and sees more than he lets on, information he sells to both nobles and merchants. Little happens without Zado somehow knowing it. Some suspect there might be multiple "Zados" throughout town working together.

#### FOLK OUT & ABOUT

While the characters are at Dulwich Marketplace, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Saku Koira** (CN middle-aged male human **spy**) stalks the market looking for easy marks. Saku is a master pickpocket. He views the market as his private domain and keeps an eye out for other pickpockets—he sometimes even intervenes so the other thief is spotted and arrested.
- 2. **Liekko Tornia** (NG female human **veteran**) browses the market; she has some spare money and seeks to spend the day relaxing after her last adventure. This stout, ruddy-faced woman is an excellent rider and a good shot with a shortbow. She likes a drink and is happy to meet new people. She knows two rumours from "Whispers & Rumours".
- 3. **Hannu Tapo** (CN young male human **commoner**) hangs about in search of opportunities. He's got the gift of the gab and exudes confidence. A scrawny fellow, he is quick-witted and locally knowledgeable and would make a good guide for adventurers new in town. He's streetwise and knows the places best to avoid. He is not, however, above making a few extra coin from his new "friends".
- 4. **Jegor Vaino** (N middle-aged male human **commoner**) works as a crier—hired to wander the market calling out his clients' offers. He has a deep baritone voice that travels far and is a charismatic man. Jegor knows much of what goes on in and around the market. He's hard to miss—he wears a garish imitation of a noble's outfit—and he seems to know all the stallholders and merchants. He is a common sight at the market and a hard worker; when it is open, he is here.
- 5. **Conza Shadowprancer** (NG female halfling **spy**) finds the market endlessly fascinating and has been exploring it for the last few days. She is new to Dulwich and plans to make the town her home for a while. She's a friendly sort and happy to chat with other travellers and the like. She's not interested in dirty and dangerous wilderness adventures, but she could be enticed to have some "fun" in town.
- 6. Kaija Ilakka (N middle-aged female human commoner) stalks the market looking for her errant husband. She thinks he is having an affair and is on the warpath—the characters had better get out of her way. If they do get in her way, she shouts at them, shakes her fist at them and generally harangues them—she is in no way intimidated by their war gear, adventurous natures and so on.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at Dulwich Marketplace, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Children Playing**: A pack of children loudly and exuberantly play a game of chase throughout the market. They rush about, hide behind stalls, bump into shoppers and so on.
- 2. **Dark Clouds Gather**: Dark clouds gather over the town, and stallholders begin to cover up or pack away their merchandise before it gets drenched.
- 3. **Busy**: The market is busy; the characters have to squeeze through the throng, and it takes time to get anywhere. Opportunities for pickpocketing are rife.
- 4. **Patrolling Watch**: Four watchmen make their way through the market. Perceptive characters notice several swarthy thugs watching the patrol.
- 5. **Argument**: Two stallholders argue over a customer; as they shout at each other, the customer gives up and wanders off.
- 6. **Quiet**: The market is quiet, and the stallholders are desperate to make money; many of them call out to the obviously wealthy adventurers as they pass by, offering free samples, special prices and more.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Thugs About**: A perceptive character notices two thugs accepting small payments from several stallholders. Clearly, many of those paying up are not happy with the situation. The thugs belong to the Shadow Spiders and are collecting protection money. The stallholders are scared, and only a persuasive and diplomatic character can get them to explain exactly what is going on.
- 2. **Gang Children Playing**: A group of children are playing loudly nearby to act as a distraction for a robbery. The children also act as a screen to slow down meddling adventurers, the town guard and so on.
- 3. **Juggling Zado**: Zado (see "Notable Folk") approaches the characters while effortlessly juggling six knives. He introduces himself and wants to know all about the party. A small crowd gathers to watch him perform.
- 4. **Thieving Child**: A child runs past the party clutching a string of sausages. Cries of "thief" ring out behind them.
- 5. **Thugs**: Four thugs push through the crowd. People get out of their way, and the thugs approach the party. The thugs aren't interested in the party, but they expect the characters to give way. An altercation could ensue if neither party is willing to back down and lose face.
- 6. **Rumours Abound**: A merchant, Isto Kalamies (LN male human **commoner**), who sells simple weapons, has a sideline as a rumourmonger. If he can lure the characters to his stall, he offers to exchange recent news for silver.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Magic Items for Sale**: If you want to buy or sell magic items in Dulwich, the best place to go is Badger's. Bernhard "Badger" Ilmatoivia has contacts throughout the town and duchy and can generally find a buyer for any enchanted item.
- 2. **Political Problems**: The village of Longbridge, which lies between Dulwich and Languard, is strategically important for trade in the duchy. It also does not currently have a lord—a situation Wido Gall, ruler of Dulwich—is keen to remedy.
- 3. **Selling Your Loot**: If you have gems, jewellery or even precious scrap metal to sell, Nalthra's Jewellery is a good place to go. Nalthra is fair and honest.
- 4. **Bandits on the Borderlands**: Bandits again haunt the southern woodlands. Several different groups are said to be in the vicinity; one such band is thought to lair in the ruined so-called Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands.
- 5. **Doings in the Mire**: Strange encounters with some of the lizardfolk of the Salt Mire have been reported by travellers and hunters. It seems some of the lizardfolk are suffering from a disease which makes them listless or homicidally violent.
- 6. **Doings in Dunstone**: The northern town of Dunstone has been quiet for decades, but a new vigour seems to be creeping over the town. Opportunities for adventure in the northern hills abound!

# WHAT' S FO R SALE?

Some or all of the items below are for sale at the market.

- 1. **Scented Candles (1 sp each)**: These specially treated candles give off a heady scent that repels the numberless flying insects lurking in the Salt Mire.
- 2. **Old Map (5 gp)**: This map depicts the Salt Mire and shows the routes of several allegedly dry(ish) trails wending their way through the morass. (The map is old, and some of these paths and trails may have moved or no longer exist.)
- 3. **Signal Arrows (1 gp each)**: These arrows have many small angled holes bored through their shaft. When an arrow is loosed, it makes a screeching sound.
- 4. **Waterproof Cloaks (5 gp)**: Of beaver skin, these cloaks are guaranteed waterproof. Each comes with a cunningly crafted cowl and has several internal pockets for keeping critical items, such as maps, dry.
- 5. **Old Travelogue (5 gp)**: This old, frayed book is bound in calfskin and written in a crabby, untidy hand. It details the travels of Iisakki Aikio through the Forest of Gray Spires. The book tells of encountering one-eyed giants, a race of evil elves and other diverse experiences.
- 6. **Guard Dog (275 gp)**: This well-trained mastiff, Kror, stands waist-high to a tall human and is powerfully muscled. The dog understands a wide range of commands, and the purchase price includes a custom set of studded leather barding.

# <span id="page-45-0"></span>12: DULWICH P OORHOUSE

The Dulwich Poorhouse is location 12 on the Dulwich map.

Girded by high, grim stone walls, the Dulwich Poorhouse is a bleak, hard place. Sadly, those dwelling within have little choice in the matter: it is the poorhouse or the street. The building is set out in a horseshoe shape around a central, muddy courtyard. Here, Chancellor Aadam Ehtaro hosts the daily hire. The poorhouse's residents earn their keep by doing the jobs no one else wants to do. In return, Aadam provides them with basic food and barely adequate shelter.

• **Lifestyle**: Characters staying at the Dulwich Poorhouse can enjoy a wretched lifestyle (0 gp) in exchange for work or a poor lifestyle (2 sp/month) if they wish to rent floor space on which to sleep.

Aadam leads a small staff of overseers, cooks and guards. None are particularly pleasant folk, but abuse at the poorhouse is rare. (Most of the staff are one-time residents who earned Aadam's trust somehow and thus have at least a small amount of empathy for their charges.)

# TH E DULWICH POORHOUSE BY DAY

The poorhouse's residents rise at dawn to be given their daily assignments by the chancellor. Shortly thereafter, they disperse to their assigned jobs, and the poorhouse is almost empty—only the sick and injured remain along with the staff. At dusk, the residents straggle back to the poorhouse to eat their evening meal and collapse into bed.

# TH E DULWICH POORHOUSE BY NIGHT

At night, the poorhouse is quiet. Most of the residents have worked hard all day at a job no one else wanted. Most are exhausted. A few chat and tells stories for a while before they slump into exhausted sleep.

# NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the Dulwich Poorhouse.

- **Chancellor Aadam Ehtaro** (LE middle-aged male human **noble**) sees the plight of the poor but is inured to their suffering. A hard but fair man, he gives what is owed and takes what is owed—no more, no less. Aadam is lean and has a hard face set in a near-constant scowl.
- **Filppu Ilakka** (N old male human **commoner**) oversees the poorhouse's kitchen. To him, this is a job. He doesn't particularly care one way or the other about his charges. He feeds them and keeps within the chancellor's budget; sometimes, he pockets some coin for himself if he gets a good deal on supplies. He has no empathy for others, and few deep thoughts disturb him.

# OTHER FOLK

While the characters are at the Dulwich Poorhouse, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Issu Miekka** (a middle-aged male human guard) lived here for a while before earning the chancellor's trust through hard work. Now, he serves as a guard. He has little empathy for those he watches—if he earned a better position through hard work and good character, so can they. He hates lazy people. Issu is seemingly always on duty, and many of the poorhouse's residents hate him.
- 2. **Helka Neuvo** (NG female human **commoner**) lived at the poorhouse because it is this or the street. She is desperate to improve her lot and escape. She is friendly—perhaps a tad too friendly as she comes across as desperate—to anyone she thinks can help her. Helka was once a seamstress, but her business collapsed after she was (falsely) accused of thievery. Abandoned by her friends and husband, she ended up here.
- 3. **Kustaa Hellikki** (CN male human **commoner**) had parents once, but they were caught in the middle of a brawl between rival adventuring groups. The brawl took a fatal turn when a drunk wizard hurled a *fireball* at his enemies—killing his parents. Kustaa hates adventurers, and he loathes wizards. He is capable of great deception to have his revenge. He is 12 years old, short, scrawny and wears clothes only a little better than rags. He is skilled at gaining other people's sympathy.
- 4. **Jaakko Vartia** (NE male human **veteran**) lost a leg three years ago in the service of Wido Gall fighting the bandits lurking in the southern woods. No good to anyone now—so it seems—he has been forced into the poorhouse. This embittered man now works here as a guard. He hobbles about on a crutch and seethes with hatred for his former lord and master. He is not a pleasant man but could be a useful ally for those working against Dulwich's lord.
- 5. **Aleksi Kokko** (N middle-aged male human **commoner**) languishes at the poorhouse because everyone hates him. Obviously, it's not his fault; no one understands him or his needs. This whining man does as little as possible and always looks out for himself. He has no friends. If the characters seem gullible, this red-faced man homes in on them and relates his (epic) sob story. His goal is to escape the poorhouse while avoiding as much work as possible. To him, any tactic to achieve this is acceptable—obviously, except hard work.
- 6. **Kreeta Ahti** (CE female human **spy**) hides in the poorhouse until the heat dies down. She recently murdered a wealthy merchant during a robbery gone wrong. In her mind, the robbery went wrong because she didn't get what she came for, not because she murdered someone. In any event, here she hides—where she thinks no one will look. She has concealed her gear—and loot—in a remote spot of the poorhouse's attic while she waits for the right time to flee. She is attractive but tries to hide her beauty as it makes her noticeable. She rarely smiles unless she is winning in some way. She is an odious person.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Dulwich Poorhouse, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Quiet**: If the characters visit during the day, the poorhouse is mostly empty—the residents not injured or sick are out working. If the characters visit at night, the residents are resting after a hard day's work.
- 2. **Maintaining the Courtyard**: A few residents—recovering from sickness—are raking the courtyard, filling in holes, repairing the flagstones and so on. All are happy to take a break and chat with wealthy visiting adventurers.
- 3. **Ragged Man**: A ragged man, Lassi Vihas (N male human **commoner**), hangs around outside the poorhouse, debating with himself whether to go in or not. After a minute or so, his shoulders slump, and he shuffles inside.
- 4. **Roll Call**: Chancellor Aadam Ehtaro (see "Notable Folk") is taking the details of all the residents still in the poorhouse. Unless someone has a good excuse for not working, they won't eat tonight.
- 5. **Argument**: Two of the residents are arguing about who owns a threadbare cloak. The two may come to blows; their shouting carries throughout the poorhouse. As the argument intensifies, other residents come to watch the inevitable fight it's free entertainment, after all.
- 6. **A Donation**: A well-to-do woman, Ulriikka Tuuli (LG female human **noble**), arrives at the poorhouse with a wagon of old spare clothes and basic foodstuffs she wants to donate to the residents. Ulrikka has a big heart and expansive wealth.

# OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Let Me Serve You**: Ari Hirvi (N young male human **commoner**) begs to serve a random character as a general servant. Ari is a poorhouse inmate and desperate to escape to better his lot and gravitates to the best-dressed character. He is a coward and is useless when actual danger appears.
- 2. **The Chancellor Will See You**: As luck would have it, Chancellor Ehtaro (see "Notable Folk") is available to meet with the characters. Even if they don't seek him out, he tracks them down to discover what the adventurers want at the poorhouse and to see if they'd be willing to make a donation.
- 3. **Besieged by the Poor**: Several of the house's residents spot the obviously wealthy characters arriving. They rush out to offer their services to the characters, beg for spare coin and so on. Quickly, the characters find themselves amid a crowd of desperate, ragged men, women and children all clamouring for attention.
- 4. **Juicy Rumour**: One of the residents (roll on "Other Folk") has just heard a juicy rumour. They relate it to the characters, for a shiny silver coin. For a gold coin, they'll remember or wildly embellish extra details.

- 5. **A Beating**: One of the residents has been caught stealing from the kitchens and is being punished. Their shouts and calls for mercy fill the air as a skinny guard, Kalle Vesivalo (CE male human **veteran**), beats them. If accosted by the characters, he stops the beating but reports the incident to the chancellor.
- 6. **Drunk Rumour**: As the characters approach the poorhouse, a drunk, Jooseppi Tapo (N middle-aged male human **commoner**), decides to spin a hilarious yarn. He tells the characters that the poorhouse's chancellor is a vampire who sups on the blood of his residents. Apparently, the chancellor is also a powerful wizard, possessing magic that lets him survive outside in the full light of day! Any halfway perceptive character can tell Jooseppi is lying, and the drunk is oblivious to the problems his "hilarious" story could cause for the chancellor, the town and the characters.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **A Necessary Evil**: Dulwich's Poorhouse is a necessary evil; without it, its residents would end up on the street, and petty crime would increase. The chancellor is not a bad man—in fact, he performs a vital service for the town.
- 2. **The Spirit of the Great Bard**: Some say the spirit of Vilimzair Aralivar himself has, in some way, imbued the Vilimzair's Arms tavern. Vilimzair is said to have played with Vainamon (N lesser god of art and music), and this connection explains why the tavern is such a hub for singers, performers and the like.
- 3. **Plague**: The plague still savages the doomed village of Ashford. How anyone is still alive there, Darlen only knows. Something should be done about it. Militant—or perhaps scared—folk call for the village to be burnt to the ground to contain the contagion.
- 4. **A Nest of Thievery**: Dulwich's Poorhouse is a front for the chancellor, Aadam Ehtaro, to enrich himself from the suffering of others. His workers pop up all around town doing the jobs no one else wants to do. Petty theft and so on often follow in their wake; the poorhouse could be a front for a criminal gang or thieves' guild!
- 5. **Bandits on the Borderlands**: Bandits again haunt the southern woodlands. Their raids are affecting trade (and taxes). Several different groups are said to be in the vicinity; one such group is thought to lair in the so-called Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands.
- 6. **The Forest of Gray Spires**: The southern forests have long been a place of mystery and ruin. Ancient ruins lie scattered throughout the forest, ensuring a steady stream of adventurers and explorers pass through Dulwich on their way south. If you seek to head south, you can always find a guide at Eronen's Safe Travels (location 8).

# <span id="page-47-0"></span>13: TH E VILIMZAIR' S ARMS

The Vilimzair's Arms is location 13 on the Dulwich map.

Named for the near-mythical bard and legendary pirate captain Vilimzair Aralivar, the Vilimzair's Arms is popular with visitors to Dulwich and locals. Bright murals depicting events in the peerless bard's life decorate the front of the building. One shows the bard charming a monstrous kraken with naught but his voice, while another depicts him alone on a burning deck fighting a pack of skeletal pirates.

This tavern caters to lovers of cheap, plentiful drinks and bawdy, joyful entertainment. The tavern's small stage hosts both musicians and singers and is just large enough for small plays. The tavern's staff are incredibly loyal to the tavern's owner, Sofia Ehtaro. Many of the staff are aspiring entertainers and vie with one another for stage time.

• **Food & Drink**: Mug of ale (4 cp), pitcher of bad wine (1 sp), pitcher of good wine (2 sp).

# TH E VILIMZAIR' S ARMS BY DAY

By day, the Vilimzair's Arms is quiet. At this time, the staff restock the bar, clean the common room, and entertainers practise, or audition, on the tavern's small stage. The tavern is open to customers during the day, but it is considerably less rowdy than it is at night.

# TH E VILIMZAIR' S ARMS BY NIGHT

At night, the Vilimzair's Arms comes alive. Sofia Ehtaro lays on entertainment every night, and the tavern stays open until late. A profusion of entertainers—both professional and amateurs perform here. Most nights, several different acts perform. The crowd is usually merry and jovial; brawls at the Vilimzair's Arms are surpassingly rare.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the Vilimzair's Arms.

- **Sofia Ehtaro** (NG middle-aged female half-elf **veteran**) can't sing, can't play any instruments and can't act. Nevertheless, this charismatic woman loves entertaining people, and this love makes her the perfect landlady of the Vilimzair's Arms. Friendly, perpetually cheerful and a good businesswoman, she has made a great success of the tavern. She is a devotee of Vainamon (N lesser god of art and music). Her regulars tolerate her infrequent performances.
- **Rauni Vaino** (NG young female human **commoner**) works at the Vilimzair's Arms because she loves it here. Rauni is the daughter of a well-to-do family. She does not need the money but loves mingling with musicians, artists and the like. Entertainment is in her blood. She is vivacious, seemingly indefatigable and popular with the regulars; she does not flaunt her wealth and dresses as a commoner while here.

• **Tyni Ilma** (LN middle-aged male half-orc **veteran**) serves as the tavern's bouncer but, in practice, does little but crowd control on busy nights. He's often half-drunk and a bit bored. He's not averse to chatting with customers and is a sucker for a pretty face.

#### FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the Vilimzair's Arms they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Maalin Vihas** (NE female human **veteran**) needs to relax after a harrowing expedition into the southern woods. In truth, she is so upset and frazzled because she almost died. The deaths of two companions affect her much less. This burly woman is half in her cups when she meets the characters.
- 2. **Suni Kare** (N male human **spy**) visits the Vilimzair's Arms in search of talent. Suni plans to put together a touring troupe of unknown "talents". Of course, when he says "unknown", he actually means "cheap". Suni has big plans—to build a reputation for himself as a master entertainer. He will use anyone to achieve his goal. He's not above trying to talk a down-on-their-luck adventurer into joining his band. Suni is a larger-than-life kind of fellow and always seems cheerful. He is skilled at appearing wealthy and empathic; he is neither.
- 3. **Pekka Uro** (CN male human **commoner**) cares for nothing but having a good time. Pekka works any job he can get to earn more money. He comes to the tavern to have fun, drink with friends new and old and forget his tedious days. In this, he is normally spectacularly successful. Sadly, he suffers from terrible hangovers and is wildly unreliable. At the Vilimzair's Arms, everyone knows his name, and he is a popular fellow.
- 4. **Eljas Arpia** (N middle-aged male human **guard**) hates his job —as a guard for a local merchant. More accurately, he hates his employer—Ambro Kallas—and has come here to drink and forget his woes. The atmosphere has cheered him up immensely, and he is working on a heroic debauch. Now past his prime, Eljas is developing a paunch and is no longer as vigilant as he once was. He would have his revenge on his master if the opportunity arose. He thinks it would be "tragic" if Ambro's business got burgled.
- 5. **Liisa Tapatora** (N female human **scout**) revels in the tavern's atmosphere. She grew up on tales of Vilimzair's derring-do and has long wanted to visit this place. A native of Languard, she has been in the town for almost three weeks and has come here every night. She is bright-eyed and visibly enjoying herself. She is happy to make new friends and knows lots of interesting and entertaining stories.
- 6. **Fosco Keenear** (NE male halfling **spy**) loves late nights at the Vilimzair's Arms. By then, most of the clientele are drunk and distracted—easy pickings for a skilled, sober pick pocket. He does not work in the early evening but often comes here to have a drink and build his persona as a regular. He abhors violence—it's messy and dangerous—and he has seen too many thieves and bandits swinging by their necks from Dulwich Keep's battlements; such a fate is not for him.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Vilimzair's Arms, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Packed**: The tavern is packed. Several popular performers are scheduled to appear, and the common room has standing room only. Some customers have spilt outside onto the street. If the weather is good, the tavern's windows have been thrown open, and the sounds of singing, dancing and laughter fill the air.
- 2. **Sofia Sings**: Taking advantage of a lull before performances, Sofia Ehtaro takes to the stage. Her short performance is obviously terrible, but the customers applaud loudly anyway.
- 3. **No-Show**: A scheduled performer has not turned up. Thus, Sofia throws the stage open to anyone who would like to take a turn. She is inundated with offers. The next hour or so sees a steady procession of singers, poets, musicians (who just happen to have their instruments with them) and so on.
- 4. **Famed Performer**: The famed chanter Dordin Farneon (NG middle-aged male dwarf **veteran**) is to perform tonight, and the common room is packed. Dordin is known for performing various dwarven chants, battle songs and elegies. He has an encyclopaedic knowledge of dwarven legends. Rumour has it he has just completed this elegy for fallen Vongyth.
- 5. **Arguing Performers**: Two different performers think they are entertaining the crowd tonight, and both have brought a gaggle of devoted fans. An argument between the two groups ensues. If they are left to their own devices, a rare brawl could break out.
- 6. **No Ale**: During a busy night, the tavern runs out of ale. With no choice, Sofia is forced to discount her more expensive wines and spirits to keep her customers happy. Excessive revelry ensues.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Vilimzair Defaced**: Vandals have defaced the tavern's murals, and Sofia wants them punished. The miscreants were in the pay of the Shadow Spiders, who were warning Sofia of the least consequence of not paying her dues. She neglects to mention this when asking the characters to hunt down the vandals but suggests they start their enquiries at the Golden Skull (location 7).
- 2. **Patrons Wanted**: Many want-to-be performers come to the tavern in hopes of securing a rich patron. Adventurers often have lots of money, and such folk are frequently targeted by musicians and the like.
- 3. **Deriding Vilimzair**: A bad-tempered customer—perhaps a visitor to the town—loudly derides the legendary bard. Staff and customers take a dim view of the man's opinion. Shortly thereafter, he is refused service and leaves shouting insults at all and sundry.

- 4. **Curious Bard**: Ilta Kultimo (NG female human **commoner**) is working on a new epic tale and needs material. She realises the characters are adventurers and starts pumping them politely and charmingly—for inspiration. She is persistent but also a good source of local information and rumours.
- 5. **Other Adventurers**: Another band of adventurers is in the taproom and spending gold like water. They speak loudly of their recent successes and future plans. Apparently, one of them has a treasure map showing the location of a ruin in the southern forests. A perceptive character spots a piece of folded parchment peeking out of one of the group's poorly laced pouch…
- 6. **No Ale**: Sofia Ehtaro has a problem: the tavern is running out of ale. Will the characters help her get some more from another local tavern? She has the means to pay for it but not the means of getting it to the Vilimzair's Arms quickly. Perhaps the characters have access to resources that could help.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **The Spirit of the Great Bard**: Some say the spirit of Vilimzair Aralivar himself has, in some way, imbued the tavern. Vilimzair is said to have played with Vainamon (N lesser god of art and music), and this connection explains why the tavern is such a hub for singers, performers and the like.
- 2. **Sofia Cursed**: Sofia Ehtaro is such a bad singer that many folk think she must have been cursed—perhaps by Vainamon himself in revenge for some terrible blasphemy. Some believe she runs the Vilimzair's Arms as a penance for her sin.
- 3. **Bandits on the Borderlands**: Bandits again haunt the southern woodlands, and the authorities are offering rewards for bandits brought alive to Dulwich Castle so that they can make bloody examples of what happens to these challenging Wido Gall's rule. Bandit raids affect trade and the town's guilds are also keen for the problem to be solved. Several different groups are said to be in the vicinity; one such band is thought to lair in the ruined so-called Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands.
- 4. **Doings in the Mire**: Strange encounters with some of the lizardfolk of the Salt Mire have been reported by travellers and hunters. It seems some of the lizardfolk are suffering from some kind of disease which makes them either listless or homicidally violent.
- 5. **Doings in Dunstone**: The northern town of Dunstone has been quiet for decades, but a new vigour seems to be creeping over the town. Opportunities for adventure in the northern hills abound!
- 6. **Bandits About**: Travellers have reported seeing signs of more bandits than normal in the environs of the eastern village of Woodridge. Maybe the village's lord has work for adventurers willing to flush them out.

# <span id="page-49-0"></span>14: TH E CROOKED HOUSE

The Crooked House is location 14 on the Dulwich map.

Thanks to its sloping, quasi-sunken appearance, the Crooked House—general shop and family home—is something of a Dulwichian landmark.

The Ilmarinen family owns the place and sells a vast array of wares from the house's cramped and dingy ground floor shop fronting Foundation Way. A jumble of storage cellars—themselves part of the house's subsidence problem—plunges deep below the three-storey building.

The Crooked House's foundations are subsiding at the rear because the building straddles a subterranean stream. Every time it rains, the house seems to sink slightly deeper, giving it a pronounced lop-sided look. Home to generations of the Ilmarinen family, the building is the subject of considerable gossip among the older generations. Some still remember the shockingly brutal murder in the cellar three decades ago and the resultant whisperings of the family's deviant religious practices.

#### TH E OFFERING

The Crooked House offers mundane items for sale at normal prices. The Crooked House does not stock weapons or armour, except a small selection of such weapons suitable for peasants and hunters. This is by design; the owners do not want adventurers poking about their shop.

#### TH E CULT

The small Braalite cult centred on the Crooked House comprises the Ilmarinen family and several of their servants (NE female or male human **Braalite cultist**). They meet on the first day of every month to venerate their vile patron in the house's deepest, mouldridden cellar. Sometimes, they kidnap a homeless person, vagrant or lone visitor. Such unfortunates invariably die horrible, soulwrenching deaths. Their remains are buried in one of the shop's deeper cellars, and their possessions are sold in the shop.

#### TH E CROOKED HOUSE BY DAY

During the day, the Crooked House sees a trickle of customers. Decent folk stay away from the Crooked House, and only Dulwich's poor or newcomers to town usually visit the shop. Even during the day, the shop floor is gloomy and shadow-filled.

#### TH E CROOKED HOUSE BY NIGHT

At night, the Crooked House is ostensibly closed; all is dark and shut up. Nevertheless, some folk occasionally report hearing odd sounds in the shop's environs. Perceptive characters may notice almost no beggars and the like hang around on Foundation Way after dark. Characters watching the shop at night might realise a surprising number of people visit the place—and stay for quite some time—on certain nights.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the Crooked House.

- **Kerttuli Ilmarinen** (NE female human **Braalite priest**) leads a small Braalite cult. Kerttuli dreams of establishing a proper shrine to Braal and has begun searching for other like-minded cults in Languard and Dunstone. Business trips—ostensibly to secure more stock—obscure the real reasons for her trips.
- **Pauli Ilmarinen** (NE male human **Braalite fanatic**) loves gold almost as much as he loves his dark patron. Intoxicated by the feeling of power he gets as he watches a sacrifice expire (preferably screaming), Pauli's soul is irredeemable.

#### FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the Crooked House they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Vilina Toiva** (N middle-aged female human **commoner**) wanders the street calling for her lost son, Urpo. Vilina is new to Dulwich—she is a weaver by trade—and does not know of the Crooked House's reputation. Evidently well off, but worried, she stops several people to ask if they have seen her son. She is grateful for any help the characters can provide and offers them a small reward.
- 2. **Tommo Niera** (N male human **commoner**) lingers outside the Crooked House waiting for other customers to go in. He needs a new cooking pot but doesn't feel safe going into the shop until other customers are present. Once inside, he asks loudly for a new pot and makes a point of making eye contact with at least one of the characters. This thin, sallow-skinned man seems consumed by nervous energy.
- 3. **Salme Kainu** (NE female human **Braalite cultist**) masquerades as a normal customer but is a cultist watching for potential troublemakers. She is ugly, has terrible breath and leers and titters at any such folk. If adventurers seem to be overly lingering in the shop, she offers to read their fortune, spouts nonsense and generally makes their shopping experience miserable.
- 4. **Sven Ihamuoto** (LG male human **acolyte** [Darlen]) lingers in the shop, driven here by some nameless compulsion to investigate. He is "in disguise"—not wearing his Darlenite regalia—but is clearly (and spectacularly) out of place. He is suspicious of everyone but not quick-witted. The Ilmarinens have their eyes on him. He might not survive his visit.
- 5. **Eljas Ampuja** (CN young male human **spy**) wanders the aisles as part of a dare. Some of his street friends bet him he wouldn't dare steal from the Crooked House. Full of youth's boundless overconfidence and sense of immortality, he makes a catastrophic mistake. One of the staff catches him and starts to drag him off to a back room. Seeing the characters, he calls for help. If they do not aid him, he is doomed to a painful death in the shop's cellars.
- 6. **Rauna Ahti** (CG female human **veteran**) makes a living as a travelling seamstress after a brief stint as a mercenary. She is here to offer her services as she has done to every other

business and home on Foundation Way. Rauna is perceptive and has realised something is not right at the shop. When the characters spot her she is in the (strange) process of talking herself out of a job. She latches onto the characters and uses them as an excuse to leave the shop.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Crooked House, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Conspiratorial Whisperings**: Three peasants whisper between themselves while pretending to browse a distant shelf. The three are cult members waiting for the shop's normal customers to leave.
- 2. **Personal Help**: Kerttuli (see "Notable Folk") wants the characters out of her shop as quickly as possible. Thus she hovers nearby and offers them attentive, persistent and unhelpful "assistance". Perceptive characters may get the impression she is trying to get rid of them.
- 3. **Empty Shop**: The shop is utterly devoid of other customers. When the characters arrive, Kerttuli quickly pronounces the shop is shutting and that the characters must leave. Ten minutes after they leave, he reopens.
- 4. **Odd Lights**: When the characters pass the shop late one night, they notice faint lights burning within. If they noisily investigate, the lights are immediately doused.
- 5. **Thumping**: A faint thumping comes from the Crooked House's cellar while the characters are browsing. If the characters ask what is going on, Kerttuli casually explains her husband is "doing some work in the cellar".
- 6. **Heavy Rain**: It is raining heavily. As the characters browse, the noisome stench of mould wafts upward from the cellars.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Missing Child**: A child has gone missing near the Crooked House, and vague whisperings lay the blame at the Ilmarinens' door. The child's parents are distraught. When the characters next pass the Crooked House, they notice the two tears streaking their faces—standing in the street looking at the shop. Inquisitive characters speaking with the pair learn of the missing child and the parents' suspicions regarding the Ilmarinens.
- 2. **Help Wanted**: The characters hear, via a circuitous route, that Kerttuli and Pauli (see "Notable Folk") seek adventurous help. If they present themselves at the shop, they discover the shopkeepers have already hired someone. Weeks later, they hear the folk hired have disappeared. The Ilmarinens refuse all subsequent offers of help.
- 3. **Crooked Directions**: When the characters are shopping for a certain item, they are directed to the Crooked House. In truth, the person directing them knows the shop does not have what they want. Rather, they hope the characters' may

- become intrigued by the shop and the rumours surrounding it and decide to investigate.
- 4. **Hidden Trapdoor**: A perceptive character browsing the shop spots the faint suggestion of a hidden trapdoor under a scuffed-up rug. If they return to investigate, they discover the rug has been replaced and a heavy table piled high with merchandise set over it.
- 5. **Something is Terribly Wrong**: If a paladin or priest of Darlen visits the Crooked House, they suddenly experience a deep sense of foreboding and a dread feeling something is terribly wrong here.
- 6. **Rumours of Horror**: As the characters approach the Crooked House, Tommo Niera (#2 "Folk Out & About") approaches them. He warns of the shop's reputation by relating rumours #3 and 4 from the list below.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Missing Tax Collector**: A tax collector disappeared while visiting the shop. Some say the Ilmarinens killed him and buried him in the cellar.
- 2. **Deep Cellars**: Foundation Way is aptly named. An older settlement once stood here, and the shops and homes are built over the top of it. Many of the buildings feature deep, multi-level cellars. Some folk speak of even older, deeper tunnels beneath the deepest cellars.
- 3. **Strange Religious Practises**: The Ilmarinen of the Crooked House worship an elder nature god. Their religious practices are abhorrent. Some people say they make horrible, blasphemous sacrifices to it.
- 4. **Brutal Murder**: A horrible murder took place in the Crooked House's cellar three decades ago. Old folk remember the lurid details: Kerttuli's father—now long dead—said he caught a thief burgling the shop. The thief resisted arrest and was killed. Why he had to be stabbed over 30 times has never been adequately explained.
- 5. **Reviled Local Landmark**: The Crooked House is a local landmark. The house is slowly sinking—no one knows why. Some people can't wait for the ground to completely swallow the building.
- 6. **Dogfighting**: Sometimes, late at night, you can hear strange sounds—yelpings and yowlings—coming from underground

near the Crooked House. Some people think the Ilmarinens r u n a s e c re t dog- fi g h t i n g ring.

<span id="page-51-0"></span>Badger's is location 15 on the updated Dulwich map.

Owned by the retired warrior Bernhard Ilmatoivia, Badger's has a good reputation in the town. Heavily fortified and watched over by the surviving fragment of the Bernhard's Badgers mercenary company, this crenellated manor house is the base of a thriving business. Badger's is a bank, moneychanger and private home. Bernhard offers a range of discreet storage options for his clients along with his moneychanging and brokerage services. His wellprotected home also sometimes serves as an auction house for expensive and rare objects; occasionally, he even brokers the sale of enchanted items.

# BADGERS BY DAY

Badger's opens during the day but is rarely busy. The services Badger's offers—bank, moneychanger and occasional purveyor of magic items—are not of interest to the average townsperson.

# BADGERS BY NIGHT

Except for good (or notably wealthy) customers or for special events such as auctions, Badger's does not open at night. However, Berhnard and his guards dwell in the manor, and it is never empty. For thieves, Badger's is a challenging target.

# NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at Badger's.

- **Bernhard "Badger" Ilmatoivia** (LN middle-aged male human **knight**) retired from adventuring when he realised he could earn just as much money without the danger of imminent death, dismemberment or disfigurement by running a bank. Bernhard has a distinctive streak of white hair in his otherwise black mane—hence his nickname. Bernhard is widely thought of as an honourable, if a little inflexible, man. He is single, lonely and would dearly love to marry. He dreams of having children and—perhaps—marrying them into the duchy's nobility.
- **Sergeant Rusi Ikitiera** (LN middle-aged male human **veteran**) oversees the 12 surviving members of the Bernhard's Badgers mercenary company. He is a wily, hugely experienced professional warrior and keeps his troops on their toes. Rusi is balding and exceptionally fit for his age. He is the epitome of a professional soldier.
- **Penna Jurva** (N young male human **guard**) dresses as a younger version of Bernhard. Once a cook's assistant for Badger's mercenary company, he now serves Bernhard as a general assistant. Despite his young age, he enjoys considerable responsibilities in regard to Badger's operation. He is an over-zealous salesman and can become irritating if he gets it into his head that a certain customer really needs a certain item.

# FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at Badger's, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Tommo Valta** (CN male human **berserker**) wants a big magic axe, and he's heard Badger's might be the place to get one. Tommo is a huge man—over seven-foot-tall—and an imposing sight in his chain shirt. He's also handsome and a little bit vain. Surprisingly, he is not stupid; far from it, in fact. However, he enjoys playing the role of the stupid barbarian, so people underestimate him. Tommo is friendly and more than happy to accompany new friends to a tavern for a drink. He likes heavy drinking, arm wrestling and other drinking games. Lowgrade trouble incessantly follows Tommo.
- 2. **Tilda Lempo** (N female human **spy**) visits Badger's with an eye to robbing the place. However, after posing as a wealthy merchant with money to deposit in Badger's vault she has decided to give the manor a miss. She's now trying to extract herself from the place without raising Bernhard's suspicions. As soon as she is able, she slips away. Perceptive characters may notice that she is nervous.
- 3. **Salme Mielikki** (NG female human **guard**) needs a job to clear her mother's large gambling debts and has come to Badger's in hopes of joining Bernhard's Badgers. She has obviously made an effort; her chain armour is gleaming, and she is clean and well-dressed. For all that, Bernhard is not hiring; he trusts his old comrades and no one else. The characters hear her being turned away by Penna Jurva and see a dejected warrior leaving the shop.
- 4. **Taavi Hirvi** (LN male human **commoner**) want to go into business with Bernhard. Taavi hails from Dunstone. A merchant selling the spirits distilled in the town, he has a side business acquiring difficult-to-find items for monied clients. He is enthusiastic, business-savvy and not above introducing himself to other prospective customers, such as the characters. Taavi is rich and travels with a dozen guards.
- 5. **Seppo Arpia** (NE male human **mage**) wants to deposit a sealed chest in Badger's vault. The chest contains certain spell components and mystical implements that could be seen as "problematical" by morally upright folk. Badger wants to know what's inside, and Seppo does not want to open the chest. An argument is brewing. Seppo is an imperious man used to getting his own way. With close-cropped black hair, a gaunt, pale face and wearing a luxurious scarlet robe encircled with a pouch-laden belt, he is an imposing sight. He is obviously a wizard.
- 6. **Miina Janakka** (LG female human **knight**) knew Badger in the "good old days" and knows him to be an honourable man. The rise of banditry in the vicinity worries Miina, and she is here to convince Badger to do something about it. She'd like him to sponsor a band of adventurers to combat the problem but has failed so far to talk the old warrior into it. If the characters are obviously adventurers, this stout, nononsense woman tries to talk them into doing something about the problem.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at Badger's, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Only Customers**: When the characters arrive at Badger's there are no other customers present. This means they get prompt, personal service from the man himself.
- 2. **Business Bet**: One of the guards bet Penna Jurva (see "Notable Folk") that he cannot sell something to the next customer through the door—and that customer happens to be one of the characters.
- 3. **Badger's Closed**: Wido Gall, ruler of Dulwich, is visiting Badger's. The shop is closed, and a dozen soldiers bearing Dulwich's colours rest outside.
- 4. **Broken Wagon**: A wagon has lost a wheel outside Badger's and now blocks the street. As several guards watch, the carter tries to change the wheel while passersby shout at him.
- 5. **Heavy Rain**: It's raining heavily, and the street is empty. A perceptive character spots two heavily cowled figures watching Badger's from a nearby doorway. Given the horrendous weather, they could have nefarious designs upon the manor and its expensive contents.
- 6. **Four Horses**: A guard holds the reins of four horses outside Badger's front door. Within, four adventurers are attempting to sell some of their recently acquired loot.

#### OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Auction**: Bernhard will soon host an exclusive auction at Badger's. He is acting on behalf of an anonymous seller who has several magic items for sale. Rumours swirl about town as to exactly what items will be up for auction. Several adventurers from Languard and elsewhere in the duchy have come to Dulwich in preparation for the auction. Such folk are an excellent source of news and rumour.
- 2. **Safe Storage**: The party have retrieved something too valuable to immediately sell or too heavy to be easily portable. Several people suggest storing the item at Badger's.
- 3. **Approaching Badger**: Bernhard has heard of the characters and seeks them out to offer his services and to see if they have anything to offer him. If they seem trustworthy (and wealthy), he invites them to tour parts of his vault to satisfy themselves as to how secure it is.
- 4. **Lonely Badger**: Bernhard is lonely and would dearly love to marry. If a woman in the party catches Badger's eye, he courts them in an archaically honourable fashion.
- 5. **Extra Security**: Bernhard is planning to auction a rare and expensive item and needs extra security for the event. If he knows and trusts the party, he asks them to help out.
- 6. **Competitive Buyer**: As a character is about to buy an item from "What's for Sale," another customer swoops in and offers 50% more than the asking price. An argument may ensure the other buyer is desperate for the item.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Badger's is Impenetrable**: Badger's features a nighimpregnable, hidden vault. It is one of the safest places in Dulwich. Money and valuables deposited there are safe—as long as you pay Badger's fees.
- 2. **Magic Items for Sale**: Badger sometimes acts as a gobetween for folk trying to buy enchanted items. He has contacts throughout the duchy and can often track down what you seek—as long as you pay his fee.
- 3. **Badger is Lonely**: Since he gave up soldiering, Badger has lived with his men. He is one of Dulwich's most eligible bachelors, and rumour has it he is lonely.
- 4. **Political Doings**: Wido Gall, ruler of Dulwich, has designs on the lordless village of Longbridge. The lord of Woodridge also covets the place, and both nobles press their claim to the village and its plentiful tax revenue. Several knowledgeable folk fear that force of arms could soon settle the issue.
- 5. **Fallen Vongyth**: Legends and rumours about the fallen dwarven hold of Vongyth are circulating again in Dulwich. It's only a matter of time before adventuring parties head east to find and explore its dusty halls. However, some confusion remains about the place's actual location; several adventuring parties have offered to pay handsomely for a map showing the fallen hold's location.
- 6. **Lord in Hiding**: Bernhard "Badger" Ilmatoivia is not a retired mercenary captain; he is a lord in exile from some distant land come here to hide from his enemies.

#### WHAT' S FO R SALE?

Some or all of the items below are for sale at Badger's.

- 1. *Potion of Greater Healing* **(250 gp)**: This silvery effervescent potion comes in a vial of hardened glass.
- 2. **Elven Chainmail (2,800 gp)**: Impossibly light and crafted from silvery metal, this supple suit of elven chain is a beautiful thing to behold. It scintillates in the light and is of high enough quality to be further enchanted.
- 3. *Ring of Protection +1* **(4,000 gp)**: This thick, burnished gold band bears intricate engraved protective runes picked out in platinum. The ring is old and probably of dwarven artifice.
- 4. **Full Plate (1,500 gp)**: Although slightly dented, this full plate armour—sized for a dwarf—is perfectly serviceable. The new owner may have to get the suit resized, but Bernhard can arrange that for them.
- 5. **Plate Barding (5,000 gp)**: Arranged on a wooden frame approximating a horse, this heavy suit of plate barding is only suitable for a warhorse. Bernhard has owned this barding for years—few people want or can afford it—and he is happy to do a deal if a customer seems genuinely interested.
- 6. **20 Silver Arrows (200 gp)**: Fletched with swan feathers, these perfectly balanced white ash arrows glisten in the light. They come with a matching quiver.

# <span id="page-53-0"></span>16: TH E THREE BELLS IN N

The Three Bells Inn is location 16 on the Dulwich map.

A stone's throw from Lawgiver's Hall (location 2), the Three Bells Inn is popular with Conn's faithful. The inn is also a favoured destination for pilgrims come to worship at the church and is often full of such transient folk. Several of the hall's clergy come here to relax and socialise and sometimes engage in lengthy theological debates about obscure points of law and faith. Such debates are well attended by the faithful, who crowd into the taproom to hear the priests' learned discourse.

- **Food & Drink**: Meal (parsnips and vegetables or lamb stew; 3 sp), mug of ale (4 cp), pitcher of wine (2 sp).
- **Accommodation**: A standard room costs 2 sp a night. The room is large and well—if plainly—furnished.
- **Lifestyle**: Characters staying at the Three Bells can enjoy a modest (1 gp/day) or comfortable (2 gp/day) lifestyle.

Persistent rumours tell of an old tunnel leading from the inn's cellar to Lawgiver's Hall, built centuries ago for a high priest who was enamoured with the wine and women then offered at the inn. The tunnel is said to also intersect with the town's catacombs, but its entrances—if it exists—have been long lost.

While outwardly welcoming, the Three Bells is a place of horror and death. Its landlord, Valto Ilakka, is a compulsive serial murderer (as was his father and father's father) who disposes of his victims in bone-choked pits dug below a deep, hidden cellar hidden behind several secret doors.

# TH E THREE BELLS BY DAY

During the day, the Three Bells Inn is quiet. Staff potter about cleaning rooms, replenishing the bar and so on while guests rest in their rooms, talk in the common room or go about their business in town.

# TH E THREE BELLS BY NIGHT

At night, the Three Bells is normally alive with the hubbub of conversation. Many of the inn's guests are pilgrims come to worship at the Lawgiver's Hall, and the crowd is not rowdy.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the Three Bells Inn.

• **Ostler Valto Ilakka** (NE middle-aged male human **assassin**) runs the Three Bells, as did his father and grandfather before him. Outwardly cheerful, and in possession of a pronounced paunch, Valto seems the archetypal ostler. Avarice and an uncontrollable desire to torture and kill lurk deep within Valto's damned heart. Publicly, he masks his base feelings and is a popular, friendly personality in the town.

• **Kaisa Janakka** (NE female human **spy**) works at the Three Bells even though she knows there is something "off" about Valto. She's grown suspicious of several architectural oddities about the building and believes the ostler hides much wealth somewhere in the building. She has decided it must be hers. While she seeks to uncover Alto's wealth, she is more than happy to rob the inn's customers.

#### FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the Three Bells, they may encounter one or more folk of interest.

- 1. **Martha Hellikki** (LN female human **commoner**) searches Dulwich for her sister who disappeared several months ago while on pilgrimage to the Lawgiver's Hall. Martha is not wealthy and lacks street smarts. She has come to Valto's (see "Notable Folk") attention, and she will shortly fall foul of the murderous ostler unless the characters openly take her under their wing.
- 2. **Katariina Ikuturso** (NG female half-elf **veteran**) ponders the wisdom of taking up an adventurer's mantle. Thus far, she's served as a mercenary guard throughout Ashlar but now craves more excitement. Katariina is brave, personable and dependable; she is a good addition to any group. Additionally, she has travelled throughout Ashlar, knows its ways, and could be a useful guide.
- 3. **Immo Kaivattu** (LN middle-aged male human **acolyte** [Conn]) enjoys wine entirely too much. Visiting Dulwich, he has elected to stay at the Three Bells so he can indulge his interest away from the hall's nosy (boring) clergy. He wears stained robes and has an air of dishevelment about him. He is more than happy to share a jack of wine with a new friend.
- 4. **Elisa Jurva** (NG female human **knight**) stands a few inches over six-foot and is an imposing figure. She seems somewhat out of place and a bit awkward in the common room. In reality, Elisa is down to her last few gold coins, and she ekes out her remaining funds. She is friendly, but proud, and interested in any legal money-making scheme.
- 5. **Aune Hirvi** (NG female human **spy**) lingers at the inn and tells anyone asking that she is waiting for a friend. She is actually a spy sent here to investigate the disappearance of Hilda Kaivas —a wandering bard whose patron has grown concerned at her absence. Hilda is reported to have stayed at the Three Bells. Her questions are making Valto Ilakka (see "Notable Folk") suspicious; she might soon "leave" the inn.
- 6. **Erivar Farsten** (LN male dwarf **veteran**) wanders Ashlar, selling his engineering and mining expertise. Valto Ilakka (see "Notable Folk") has asked him to plan the excavation of a new cellar—separate and distinct from the inn's existing cellar—and he is mulling over the plans. To Erivar's mind, the cellar is too deep—building at that depth will be needlessly expensive, and he is keen to discuss the matter further with his client. The characters may spot him poring over the plans. (Once the cellar is complete, Valto plans to do away with the dwarf, so none know of the cellar's details.)

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Three Bells, one or more things from the list below may occur.

- 1. **Quiet**: The common room is quiet, and half the inn's rooms are available to rent. A large group of pilgrims has recently left Dulwich; consequently, the characters can get a deal on accommodation if they haggle.
- 2. **Lively Debate**: A group of Connite worshippers and priests are engaged in a lively debate on some obscure point of church law. The debate is loud but good-natured. Several other patrons listen quietly.
- 3. **Friendly Ostler**: Valto Ilakka (see "Notable Folk") recognises the characters as adventurers and makes casual and polite conversation with them. He wants to ascertain if they are a threat to his activities; perceptive characters may find his questioning invasive.
- 4. **Ale Delivery**: A local merchant delivers a dozen barrels of ale. They stand in the common room until they can be moved to the cellar. Valto does this on his own and refuses all offers of assistance.
- 5. **Waiting Carpenter**: A local carpenter has arrived to do some work at the inn. He does not understand his assignment and waits to talk with Valto Ilakka (see "Notable Folk"). Why does Valto want such a reinforced door for the attic?
- 6. **Angry Conversation**: Martha Hellikki (see "Folk Out & About") is quizzing Valto Ilakka (see "Notable Folk") about her missing sister. Valto professes no knowledge of the missing woman, but Martha has become convinced he is lying. As the conversation progresses, she gets louder and louder, much to Valto's discomfort.

# OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere. Unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Stolen Relic**: A holy relic has been stolen from the Lawgiver's Hall. The chief suspect, Inga Kare, stayed at the Three Bells, and speculation runs rampant that she used the old lost tunnel to perpetrate the theft. She has now disappeared, however. Vuokko Laiten, high priestess of Conn, demands the truth of the ancient tunnel is ascertained—perhaps Inga yet hides within and plans more thefts? (Inga has already fallen prey to Valto's terrible depredations, and he has hidden the relic in a deep cellar until he can decide what to do with it.)
- 2. **Missing Pilgrim**: A pilgrim, Aino Hellikki, went missing during her visit to Dulwich. Her sister, Martta (LN female human **commoner**), is in town, intent on tracking her down. She questions the party before falling into Valto's clutches. If the characters then hear she has also gone missing, they may become suspicious and investigate.
- 3. **Hard-Up Warrior**: Elisa Jurva (see "Folk Out & About") approaches the party to see if they have the need for another warrior in the group. Even if they do not, she is content to chat for hours—she has little else to do.

- 4. **Faint Smell of Death**: As a character exits the inn to go about their business, they detect a faint smell in the air. If they are perceptive, they recognise the smell as that of rot and death.
- 5. **Belligerent Clergy**: A quartet of the more militant, firebrand members of Conn's clergy believe Valto Ilakka (see "Notable Folk") must have been in on the recent theft of a holy relic (Opportunities & Complications #1). Determined to get to the bottom of things, the four burst into the common room and demand to search the inn. This is—obviously—disastrous news for the ostler who makes strenuous efforts to stymie their demands. He even calls for the watch to eject the clerics.
- 6. **Many Pilgrims**: As the characters take their ease in the taproom, the inn quickly fills with pilgrims. A large group of worshipers has just arrived from Dunstone, and all seek board and lodge. The staff are rushed off their feet. The characters may spot Aune Hirvi taking the opportunity to skulk about.

#### WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below.

- 1. **Old Tunnel**: An old tunnel links the Three Bells to the nearby Lawgiver's Hall. The tunnel intersects the catacombs beneath the cathedral, but knowledge of its entrances was lost decades ago.
- 2. **Transient Workers**: The ostler at the Three Bells Inn is always seeking new staff; for some reason, few people work there for long, and the place is always short-staffed.
- 3. **Family Business**: The Three Bells is a family business; the Ilakkas have owned it for almost a century. The clergy at the Lawgiver's Hall try to buy the inn every decade or so, but they are always rebuffed.
- 4. **Unbelieving Ostler**: Valto Ilakka makes much money from the Lawgiver's Hall but is never seen worshipping there; many of the faithful resent that the innkeeper makes so much money from their brethren (without putting some of it back on the collection plate).
- 5. **Breached Catacombs**: There must be an entrance to the catacombs somewhere in the vicinity of the Lawgiver's Hall. Sometimes, strange smells hang in the wind, and some folk have reported hearing odd sounds; perhaps not all the catacomb's residents rest easily.
- 6. **Southern Doings**: Loggers and tree-fellers report a strange, unnerving atmosphere in the deep southern woods. Wildlife seems subdued, and even the colours seem subtly wrong.

Most people dismiss their talk as n o t h i n g b u t t h e d r u n k e n ramblings of simple folk. Others remember the tales of olden empires hidden deep in the Gray Spires and wonder if an a n c i e n t p o w e r i s stirring.

# <span id="page-55-0"></span>17: TH E OZLOC & DRAGON

This low, single-storey tavern has a broad frontage accessed from a newly repaved wide alleyway running north from Foundation Way. It stands at the junction of Foundation Way and Broad Street.

What was once the ramshackle and low-class Green Griffon tavern has been transformed through the liberal expenditure of gold into an upmarket establishment fit for Dulwich's great and good. The tavern stocks a wide range of fine wines and spirits imported from Languard and its owner's, Rister Lempinen's, native Dunstone. A wide range of beers and ciders are also available— Rister has worked hard to make many friends in the Brewer's Guild. Food is also of the highest quality—with cooks and ingredients coming from all over the duchy. The place is a far cry from its old self.

# TH E OZLOC & DRAGON BY DAY

The Ozloc & Dragon opens at noonday to serve light lunches and drinks to Dulwich's moneyed merchants. The place offers a quiet haven to meet, talk and make deals. During the day, the tavern is rarely busy, and Rister has more time to talk with his customers. The tavern's private dining room is also available for meetings at this time.

# TH E OZLOC & DRAGON BY NIGHT

Once the day's business is done, a trickle of monied merchants and other affluent folk make their way to the Ozloc & Dragon for dinner and drinks. The tavern is a new addition to Dulwich's nightlife, and thus, it is rarely busy. Rister is keen to attract the right sort of clientele and is still mulling over this problem. The tavern shuts around midnight, and the staff are gone an hour or so later.

#### NOTABLE FOLK

Some folk are often encountered at the Ozloc & Dragon:

- **Rister Lempinen** (LN middle-aged male human **noble**) loves people—particularly rich people who he knows will pay much for the finer things in life. He dreams of entering high society and becoming a person of influence and note. Rister is friendly and well-dressed. Violence and physical danger frighten him—he wishes he was more like the great hero Sir Ozloc the Brave. He left Dunstone because of the wild stories of a red dragon—a red dragon Sir Ozloc himself could not defeat—lurking in the hills to the west.
- **Aune Montaja** (LN middle-aged female human **commoner**) oversees the taproom. Always polite and impeccably turned out, Aune is an asset to the tavern. She knows many of Dulwich's wealthy personages and is on first-name terms with some of them. She wears her long brown hair tied back in an ornate ponytail.

# FOLK OU T & ABOUT

While the characters are at the Ozloc & Dragon, they may encounter one or more folk of interest:

- 1. **Antero Kalervo** (LN middle-aged male human **noble**) dines with a friend and fellow merchant. Antero has a problem—a stonemason working in his cellar was repairing a wall when he discovered a hidden room and staircase. Antero really needs a group of specialists to explore what lies beyond. (Refer to any of the Nameless Mage Dungeon Backdrops for more information).
- 2. **Noora Joutsi** (NG female human **noble**) visits Dulwich in hopes of selling Rister some of her fine spirits—as she knew him when he lived in Dunstone. She is well dressed and attended by a servant who carries several samples of her wares. Noora is polite and friendly to all and is always looking to make new business contacts. Adventurers fascinate her.
- 3. **Riitta Osma** (N old female human **noble**) rose from humble beginnings to be a successful merchant. She remembers her father bringing her here when it was the Green Griffon. She comes to the Ozloc & Dragon to reminisce and will do so with almost anyone; she knows much of the town's history and remembers the old stories about the inn's suspiciously ancient cellar.
- 4. **Sir Salomo Miemo** (LG male human **knight**) dines here because he is a noble and although he is a goodly soul, he is more comfortable mixing with fellow people of high birth. Sir Salomo is visiting Ashlar from a foreign land and is keen to explore the Forest of Gray Spires.
- 5. **Lydia Kalevon** (LN female dragonborn **veteran**) stands resolutely outside the tavern, acting as a bouncer and greeter. She wears voluminous red robes and is polite but is not a talkative soul. She can also be stern and does not suffer fools gladly. Sometimes, humans baffle her.
- 6. **Lassi Repo** (LN middle-aged male human **noble**) loves the Ozloc & Dragon. He is a snob and loves being seen here—as only the "right sort" gain admittance. This wealthy merchant is here with his paramour, Elina Kuura (N female human **spy**). Little does he know that this beautiful woman works for one of his rivals and that she plans to rob him blind once she has milked him for all she can get. She is an excellent actress, but a perceptive character may detect a "hard edge" to her.

# DRESS CODE & RIFF RAFF

The Ozloc & Dragon serves wealthy patrons and operates a subtle but strict dress code to keep out the riff raff. Customers must look the part and characters turning up in armour or their normal travel clothes—even if they are here to meet a wealthy patron—will be politely turned away.

# WHAT' S GOING ON?

While the characters are at the Ozloc & Dragon, one or more things from the list below may occur:

- 1. **Quiet**: The Ozloc & Dragon is quiet; if the characters are dressed appropriately, they easily secure a table.
- 2. **Rister on the Floor**: Rister is making an effort to meet, greet and get to know his customers. He is incredibly friendly and welcoming to everyone (or at least everyone with ready coin to spend).
- 3. **Busy**: The Ozloc & Dragon is busy, and Rister is literally vibrating with excitement as he hopes the tavern's popularity is growing. Sadly, unless the characters are wealthy or important, there is no empty table available.
- 4. **Annoying Drunk**: A drunk commoner stands outside the inn shouting incoherent insults at the customers within. The man once drank here when it was the Green Griffon and hates what Rister has done to "his" tavern.
- 5. **Closed**: The Ozloc & Dragon is closed for a private function; sounds of merriment emanate from within.
- 6. **Ozloc's Adventures**: Rister is a huge fan of Sir Ozloc the Brave and is enthusiastically (and loudly) recounting stories of the half-elf's adventures to a customer.

# OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS

Lucky adventurers find opportunities almost anywhere; unlucky adventurers find complications almost anywhere.

- 1. **Complaining Merchant**: The merchant Antero Kalervo "Folk Out & About #1" sits with a friend and a character overhears him moaning that he has a problem in his cellar, which requires adroit handling by "specialists".
- 2. **Rister Greets the Party**: Rister introduces himself to the characters and tries to get to know them. He senses they are adventurers and knows several patrons in need of such folks' services. Depending on how their conversation progresses, he may or may not pass on their names. In this way, he hopes his wealthy customers will see him as the kind of person who "knows people".
- 3. **Vandalised Sign**: The tavern's ornate wooden sign has been vandalised—someone has thrown paint all over it. A character cleaning it (perhaps with magic) gets a free bottle of wine and Rister's thanks.
- 4. **Stolen Sign**: The characters hear Rister bemoaning that someone has stolen the tavern's ornate wooden sign. He would be grateful to anyone retrieving it. (Luckily, he has a spare, as this is not an isolated incident.)
- 5. **Annoying Drunk**: As #4 "What's Going On" but the drunk staggers into the inn and creates a terrible scene. If the characters help to discreetly resolve the problem, they gain Rister's thanks (and a free bottle of wine).
- 6. **Giants Rats**: Rat tunnels intersect the inn's cellar, and several giant (perhaps diseased) rats burst into the common room. Rister is horrified, and chaos reigns.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

The characters may overhear or learn some of the rumours (which may or may not be true) below:

- 1. **Tax the Rich**: Things are good in Dulwich, and its folk grow wealthy—particularly the merchants. Wido Gall is planning a new tax on the merchants, and they are not happy about it.
- 2. **Foundation Way's Deep Cellars**: Foundation Way is aptly named. An older settlement once stood there, and the street's shops and homes were built over the top of it. Many of the buildings feature deep, multi-level cellars. Some folk speak of even older, deeper tunnels.
- 3. **'Ware the Dragon**: A dragon's lair—complete with a red dragon—has been discovered buried in the hills to the west of Dunstone. Apparently, the beast lairs in caverns below a ruined monastery. Most of the adventurers who made the discovery are dead; only one survivor—the heroic, and fleet of foot, half-elf, Sir Ozloc the Brave of Mossvale—escaped the beast. Some folk name the half-elf a hero for bringing news of the danger back to the town, while others mutter he abandoned his friends to save his own skin.
- 4. **The Ozloc & Dragon is the Place**: The Ozloc & Dragon is Dulwich's newest exclusive tavern catering to only the town's wealthiest and most influential folk. Here, Dulwich's riff-raff are not welcome, the prices are high, and the owner enforces a strict dress code. If you want to meet the town's movers and shakers, this is the place.
- 5. **Angry Regulars**: Many of the regulars of the old Green Griffon—the tavern that preceded the Ozloc & Dragon—are angry at their beloved watering hole's fate. Sometimes, they turn up outside and shout at the monied folk ruining "their" tavern.
- 6. **Old Cellar**: The Ozloc & Dragon's cellar is much older than the building above. Some folk say the cellar is a remnant of the old settlement that predated Dulwich.

# <span id="page-58-0"></span>TH E SURROUNDS

# <span id="page-59-0"></span>TH E SURROUNDING WOODLANDS

The Shadowed Keep stands at the end of an overgrown trail upon a wooded bluff overlooking a steep-sided valley. A small pack of wolves dwells in the wood as does a black bear. Characters wandering the woods may also encounter small hunting parties of bandits and goblins skulking in the gloom.

Beyond the Shadowed Keep, several other locations of interest lie in the woodland to the south of Dulwich. While this adventure cannot provide comprehensive detail of all these locales, some of the more prominent and interesting are detailed below to enable further design and development.

# TRACKS & TRAILS

A network of tracks and trails honeycomb the woodlands to the south of Dulwich. Dulwich itself stands on the South Road, which skirts the southern edge of the Salt Mire and links the western and eastern portions of the duchy. This road—a vital artery for commerce in Ashlar—is well-travelled and heavily patrolled by Wido Gall's loyal troops. Still, banditry is a constant menace.

# RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

Characters exploring the area around the keep may encounter some of the denizens lairing nearby. Alternatively, they may encounter some of the creatures dwelling in the keep. Every hour the characters are in the area surrounding the ruin, they have a 1 in 20 chance of encountering something. Roll on the table below to determine what the characters encounter.

# **D20 ENCOUNTER, EVENT OR DISCOVERY**

- 1 **Tracks**: The characters discover bandit tracks. A DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies the tracks as those of four humans. They lead toward the keep.
- 2 **Crossbow Bolt**: A crossbow bolt sticks in a tree. Judging by the moss growing on the tree's trunk and the bolt's shaft it has been here for some time.
  - **Bandits**: This group comprises one **brigand veteran**  and **three brigands**; they are only interested in attacking defenceless travellers. If the characters have previously attacked the Shadowed Keep's watchtower, the bandits unleash a volley of crossbow bolts before fleeing. This encounter does not occur at night.
- 4 **Wolves**: Searching for food, two **wolves** attack the party, and focus their attention on the smallest character. A wolf reduced to half hit points, flees.
- 5 **Campsite**: The characters discover a recently used campsite. A DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals the campsite was used two days ago by a small group of man-sized humanoids.
- 6 **Goblins**: Three **Blood Moon warriors** sneak through the wood searching for victims. They only attack small or weak groups; otherwise they retreat to warn their master of intruders.

- 7 **Goblins**: Six **Blood Moon warriors** search for bandits to kill and loot. Emboldened by their numbers, they attack from ambush, if they get the chance.
- 8 **Black Bear**: The bear shambles out of a deep thicket. It is initially indifferent to the characters and attacks only if provoked. It dwells in a small, dry cave nearby.
- 9 **Discarded Sack**: A small sack lies in the undergrowth (DC 15 Wisdom [Perception] spots); it holds four day's worth of trail rations, a waterskin and a pouch containing 15 sp.
- 10 **Ruined Cottage**: Perhaps once the home of a charcoal burner or hunter this cabin was abandoned years ago. Its roof has collapsed and its small root cellar is all but filled with leaves and other wind-blown detritus. (The cellar could make a good wolfs' den).
- 11 **Heavy Rain**: Heavy rain pummels the woodland. Characters not seeking shelter quickly get soaked (and miserable). The rain lasts for several hours.
- 12 **Quiet Woods**: One of the characters notices the woods have gone unnaturally quiet, all of a sudden. Is something creeping up on them or are they about to make an unwholesome and distasteful discovery?
- 13 **Deep Thicket**: The trees grow tall and close together, here. Gloom blankets the forest floor and going is slow. Treat the area as difficult terrain.
- 14 **Meadow**: A huge fallen tree has created a break in the forest canopy. In the sunlight, a wide swath of wild flowers and small bushes have taken hold.
- 15 **Deer**: Rustling nearby presages the appearance of two **deer**. The pair bolt, if the characters make sudden movements or attack them.
- 16 **Webs**: Thick webs festoon the branches of a dense stand of trees filling a small hollow. The hollow is gloomy and cold. Herein dwell four **wolf spiders**.
- 17 **Burial Cairn**: An old burial cairn of tumbled stone stands atop a low rise. The remains of a black flag bearing a rampant stag hangs listlessly above the cairn.
- 18 **Dead Goblin**: A decomposing goblin corpse lies sprawled under a bush. A crossbow bolt protrudes from its back. The body has been comprehensibly looted.
- 19 **Unicorn**: A **unicorn** grazes on the grass in a small clearing. If the characters are goodly, the unicorn, Vilimza, may speak with them or even heal the party's injuries. This is a good random encounter to run if the characters are lost or need critical information. Vilimza does not join the party.
- 20 **Double Trouble**: Two encounters occur at the same time. Roll twice more on this table to determine what happens; re-roll any subsequent result of 20.

#### <span id="page-60-0"></span>LOCAL FEATURES O F INTEREST AT A GLANCE

Beyond the Shadowed Keep, several other locations of interest lie in the woodland to the south of Dulwich. Many other sites of minor note stud the woodlands. Such locales include isolated cottages (the homes of charcoal burners, hunters and the like) as well as logging camps, bandit hideouts and so on. Additionally, characters exploring the woods will likely encounter many of its denizens—some benign, some ambivalent and some malign.

**Elle's Mere**: Elle's Mere is a rarely visited, reputedly haunted place. Tavern tales, whispered rumours, and local legends name the lake's shaded waters as home to ghosts, water spirits and worse. Even the trees growing about the lake are said to come alive to slay those venturing too close to the lake.

**Forest of Gray Spires**: While not part of Ashlar, the Forest of Gray Spires forms its southern border. Deemed all but impenetrable, wild rumours cluster thickly about these brooding woodlands and the legion of strange, slender rock spires thrusting upwards from the plateau on which the forest stands.

Adventurers often use Dulwich as a base from which to explore the forest. Many of the legends hanging over the strange forest speak of ancient inhuman empires and their glittering treasures. The Picaroon Peninsula lies hundreds of miles west and south of Dulwich; no known land route exists through the forest, but that doesn't stop the occasional explorer or traveller claiming to have forged such a route.

**Shunned Valley of the Three Tombs**: Hidden deep in the forest lies a marshy, boggy valley. Woodsmen and hunters shun the place—kept away by rumours of a terrible beast lairing within and of a ghost haunting the valley's boggy mere. But, as well as great danger, treasures magical and mundane may yet lie unclaimed in the valley, for three unexplored tombs, built by ancient hands, stand amid the mud and reeds. (For more about the valley, refer to "Shunned Valley of the Three Tombs").

**Slaughter Meadow**: This wide swath of undead-haunted greensward nestles amid the surrounding forest. Valentin Ironwolf won a great victory here when he defeated the orcs of the Severed Hand and the Blood Moon goblins at the Battle of Slaughter Meadow. Undead are said to haunt the old battlefield.

**The Demon's Bowl**: Here, a steep-sided natural amphitheatre plunges downwards several hundred feet. A rugged outcropping of jagged rock at the bowl's lowest point has given rise to numerous rumours of demon worship and foul sacrifices hanging over the place. A nameless hamlet of shacks and rude cabins straggles through the bowl. Some of the folk dwelling in the bowl suffer from leprosy; few visit the place, as a result, and Wido Gall's troops stay well clear.

**Tower of Kivutar**: The bandits and goblins lurking in the southern woodlands have learnt to avoid the Tower of Kivutar. Herein dwells the wizard Kivutar Ilmarinen (LG old female human **mage**). She is a recluse of sorts but occasionally wanders the woods near her home to gather berries, herbs and other things she needs for her experiments. Despite a foul reputation, Kivutar is a good person and helps those in need if she can.

**Valley of Bones**: Piercing the foothills of the nameless range of tree-crowned hills rising up to form the mysterious plateau on which stands the Forest of Gray Spires, the valley is a place rich in local legend. The kobolds of the Ebon Scales once claimed the valley, but Valentin Ironwolf annihilated them. The Valley of Bones is named for the battle's aftermath.

**Vongyth**: Vongyth fell to the depredations of a pair of mated dragons two centuries ago. The dragons have since been slain by the Crimson Swords adventuring group, but adventurers still go missing searching for the ruin. It is generally assumed something terrible yet lurks in the eternal dark of Clan Nurthen's fallen home.

# <span id="page-61-0"></span>ELLE' S MERE

Crowded close by thick stands of trees clustering hard against its banks, Elle's Mere is a rarely visited, reputedly haunted place. Tavern tales, whispered rumours, and local legends name the lake's shaded waters as home to ghosts, water spirits and worse.

A ring of partially submerged stone monoliths surrounds a low, swampy tree-choked island rearing from the lake's centre. Amid the fecund undergrowth at the island's highest point stands an altar of black rock worn smooth by the rains of countless years.

A tumbled stone wall, slick with moss and lichens and obscured by thick stands of rushes, bounds the island, hinting at its artificial origin. The island is the top of a huge sacred barrow mound built hundreds of years ago by a people long since faded from the world. The (now partially flooded) barrow served as a tribal burial place and is yet watched over by an ancient guardian —a slumbering **treant** so old it has taken root above the barrow.

A colony of giant frogs dwells in and around Elle's Mere. Their cacophonous night-time croaking has given rise to the legends of ghostly hauntings at the lake.

# FOREST O F GRAY SPIRES

South of Ashlar, where the southern woods grow thick against a lofty plateau, the woodlands give way to the legend-wreathed Forest of Gray Spires. Here, tall, slender spires of grey rock tower above the densely packed trees clustering thickly about their flanks. Eroded into weird and fantastical shapes by frequent, fierce rains lashing the plateau, these jagged splinters of limestone rear from the forest like the towers of some legendary lost fortress.

The forest is a torturous, labyrinthine place which remains almost completely unexplored. Few paths pierce its depths, and no accurate maps of the interior are known to exist. The dense forest and horrendous terrain effectively block all but the most determined or desperate of travellers.

Rumours and legends about the forest are legion. Some tales tell of a race of semi-intelligent apes dwelling deep in its most inaccessible reaches atop spires they have carved to suit their atavistic tastes. Others speak of a fallen race of forsaken, demonworshipping elves or even a lingering enclave of cyclops yet clinging to their ancient heritage amid the crumbling, mossy ruins of their former kingdom.

- **DC 20**: The elves of the Gray Spires battled an ancient enemy millennia ago. They defeated their enemy, but they fell into darkness and shadow.

# SHUNNED VALLEY O F THE THREE TOMBS

Far from Dulwich, hidden deep in the forest, lies a marshy, boggy valley. Woodsmen and hunters shun the place—kept away by rumours of a terrible beast lairing within and of a ghost haunting the valley's boggy mere. But, as well as great danger, treasures magical and mundane may yet lie unclaimed in the valley, for three unexplored tombs, built by ancient hands, stand amid the mud and reeds.

- **DC 15**: A pool—Aila's Mere—named for an adventurer who drowned therein long ago fills much of the valley.
- **DC 20**: Three tombs are said to lie in the valley itself. They are variously thought to be the resting place of ancient and savage barbarians, forgotten kings or even the burial site of a long-forgotten hobgoblin tribe.

**More**: For more about the valley, refer to "The Shunned Valley".

#### SLAUGHTER MEADOW

This wide swath of greensward nestles amid the surrounding forests. Well watered by several streams flowing down from the southern hills, the meadow would be bucolic except for the vast quantity of bleached bones, rusting equipment and the like dotting the once peaceful place. Both corporeal undead (mainly **skeletons**, but sometimes **ghouls**) and incorporeal undead (mainly **ghosts** and **spectres**) are occasionally encountered here. Sometimes, adventurers come to Slaughter Meadow to search the battlefield for long-dropped loot. Some such heroes watered the meadow with their blood and added their bones to those of the numberless fallen.

- **DC 10**: Valentin Ironwolf fought the orcs of the Severed Hand and the Blood Moon goblins at the Battle of Slaughter Meadow. It was the doughy adventurer's most famous battle. During the fighting, Valentin slew the Severed Hand's chief, Baggi the Deluded, in single combat.
- **DC 15**: The battlefield is haunted. Every year, on the anniversary of the battle, the dead rise to fight once again. (While widely believed this is untrue…probably).
- **DC 20**: The orc chieftain, Baggi the Deluded, wielded an enchanted axe which was lost during the fighting. The axe, named *Thaliat* by the elves, was reputed to have the powers of a *flame tongue* weapon.

# TH E DEMON' S BOWL

Deep in the forest, a steep-sided natural amphitheatre plunges downwards several hundred feet. A rugged outcropping of jagged rock at the bowl's lowest point has given rise to numerous rumours of demon worship and foul sacrifices.

A nameless hamlet of shacks and rude cabins straggles through the bowl. Its people are displaced, hapless folk. Here they dwell far from Lord Wido Gall's easy grasp, trusting to the dark legends of the place to keep Gall's soldiery and roving bandits away. Along with the outlaws and dispossessed, a small band of lepers also dwell here in a small network of dry caves far away from the other bowl's other folk.

The bowl's folk are foresters, hunters and—occasionally thieves of opportunity surviving however they can. The community numbers roughly 100 souls, 18 of whom suffer from leprosy. Some have nowhere else to go, while others dwell here because they like the peace, seclusion and freedom. Most of the bowl's inhabitants know the surroundings well and could serve as local guides. Money has little use for these folk; rather, most prefer payment in useful tools, luxuries such as wine and other finished goods they otherwise lack.

Notable folk include:

- **Heta Ihamuoto** (CG female human **bandit captain**) serves as the de facto leader of the bowl's folk. Friendly but wary toward newcomers, she suspects visitors of being Wido Gall's spies and watches them closely. Earning her trust is difficult. She does not, however, turn anyone in true need away.
- **Iisak Jurva** (NE middle-aged male human **commoner**) suffers from leprosy and, with a bitter heart, rails against his fate. Angry at the world and furious with anyone he thinks could heal him but chooses not to, he particularly hates clerics and the like. Murder lurks in his heart, and he is not above deliberately attempting to infect newcomers who fail to help him. Iisak has no eyebrows, and the disease has begun to melt his nose.

• **Esko Paasia** (NG young male human **commoner**) exhibits endless curiosity about the outside world and could easily become infatuated with an adventurous newcomer. He might become obsessed with a heroic warrior type or develop a devastating crush on an attractive woman in the group. Barely 15, and full of the invincibility of youth, he might follow an adventuring party when they set forth to explore the southern woods. He knows the area well and is an athletic youth blissfully unaware of his own shortcomings.

- **DC 20**: Some of the folk dwelling in the bowl suffer from leprosy. They dwell in caves and roam the surrounds.

# TOWER O F KIVUTAR

The bandits and goblins lurking in the southern woodlands have learnt to avoid the Tower of Kivutar. Standing on a low hill overlooking a sluggish river meandering from the gloom of the deep woods, the tower (and its mistress) are well known in Dulwich but seldom visited.

Herein dwells the wizard Kivutar Ilmarinen (LG old female human **mage**). She is a recluse of sorts but occasionally wanders the woods near her home to gather berries, herbs and other things she needs for her experiments. Ill-at-ease with other folk, she does not turn away those in need. A courteous and respectful adventuring party could find her a useful ally.

- **DC 20**: In her youth, Kivutar was a renowned adventurer and known to be a strong defender of the common folk.

#### VALLEY O F BONES

Piercing the foothills of the nameless range of tree-crowned hills rising up to form the mysterious plateau on which stands the Forest of Gray Spires, the valley is a place rich in legend.

Contorted dwarf oaks, their lichen-cloaked boughs and branches twisted into fantastical shapes, grow between mosswreathed boulders fallen from the cliffs above. The valley floor is <span id="page-63-0"></span>rocky and uneven and prone to suddenly drop off into steepsided pits, hollows and troughs gouged from the valley floor by some unknown, ancient process. This is a feral, primal place.

A fast-flowing stream courses through the valley over a halfdozen waterfalls and through a series of deep plunge pools before it turns north and west to join the mighty Selka. An overgrown pathway threads its way through the gloomy valley. Sometimes the path runs along the stream's banks, while other times it veers off into the valley's interior. At two points, the path traverses the stream on weirs of slick and slimy piled stone.

Named for the aftermath of Valentin Ironwolf's most successful campaign, where once it resounded to the harsh clarion of battle, the Valley of Bones is now a quiet place. Here, the Ironwolves trapped and annihilated the kobolds of the Ebon Scales. The kobolds dwelled in a series of small caves at the valley's head, and although they had set many traps in the valley, Valentin slowly wore down their defences over a week of bitter struggle. Trapped in the valley, the kobolds had nowhere to flee and were eventually obliterated—Valentin putting to the sword even the young in an orgy of slaughter.

#### LORE

A character making a DC 10 Intelligence or Intelligence (History) check knows something about the Valley of Bones. A successful check gains all the information revealed by a lesser check.

- **DC 10**: The Valley of Bones was the site of the Ironwolf's most comprehensive victory—the annihilation of the kobolds of the Ebon Scales.
- **DC 15**: The kobolds of the Ebon Scales dwelled in a series of tunnels at the head of the valley and, uncharacteristically, defended their home to the last.
- **DC 20**: A green dragon once dwelt in the valley, but adventurers slew it a century ago.

#### VONGYTH

Two centuries ago, the dwarves of clan Nurthen were typical of their kind. Dwelling in the fortified mine-hold of Vongyth, these industrious miners toiled deep beneath the earth to bring forth precious metals. Doughty warriors all, they fought hard to defend their home from the foul humanoids dwelling in the bizarre, grotesque depths of the Forest of Gray Spires.

Cut into the northern flank of the nameless plateau upon which stands the Forest of Gray Spires in the wilderlands beyond the Duchy of Ashlar's southern border, Vongyth is a small, isolated place. To the west, on Vongyth's very doorstep, Kymi's Run tumbles down Thangar's Steps before flowing sluggishly northwards through the human village of Longbridge and under its bridge of olden dwarven artifice into the Salt Mire. To the south lies nothing but the oppressive gloom of the Forest of Gray Spires —a vast stretch of gnarled trees clustering thickly about strange and fantastical twisted columns of jagged grey stone thrusting grotesquely, almost blasphemously, skyward.

Proficient miners, the dwarves were wealthy, and it was their wealth that spelt their doom. A mated pair of green dragons, Klauthosk and Yeiarxin, fell upon several merchants carrying gold bars and other precious metals northwards into the Duchy of Ashlar for trade. After torturing (and then eating) the few survivors, the pair learnt Vongyth's location and shortly thereafter—exhibiting typical, draconic greed—led their kobold minions in a devastating attack on the unsuspecting dwarves.

With acid and fang, the dragons drove the dwarves from their fortress, slaughtering all who resisted them. (Many of the survivors sought sanctuary in the subterranean dwarven fortress of Don Galir below the human village of Wellswood; the others dispersed further afield—many leaving Ashlar for good.) After the orgy of slaughter and looting, Klauthosk and Yeiarxin settled in the hold and ordered their kobold servants to find every scrap of treasure hidden therein. Sated by the carnage and the dwarves' hoardwealth, Yeiarxin laid several eggs, and the dragons began to terrorise and loot the surrounding area.

Thus did matters stand until the Crimson Swords invaded the hold 40 years later and slaughtered Klauthosk and Yeiarxin along with scores of their fanatical, diminutive servants. Exulting in their victory, the surviving adventurers looted the dragons' hoard and returned to civilisation to bask in the common-folks' adulation and to enjoy all the comforts of life their new wealth could provide.

The years after the Crimson Swords slew Klauthosk and Yeiarxin saw a slow trickle of adventurers and dwarves seeking Vongyth—the adventurers in hopes of finding glimmering treasures missed by the Crimson Swords and the dwarves in the hopes of reestablishing their ancient home. None who have passed Vongyth's graven valves of bronze-banded stone have returned to tell of what now lurks among the ruin of this shattered, fallen hold. Some folk whisper of a curse lingering over the place, while others mutter that perhaps the Crimson Swords did not slay all the dragons. Whatever the truth of the matter, few people now willingly seek out Vongyth.

A dwarf native to Ashlar automatically knows the information revealed by a DC 15 check and gains advantage on any checks made to recall further information. A successful check reveals all information gained by a lesser check.

- **DC 10**: Vongyth was a dwarven hold known for its deep mines and industrious folk. Two centuries ago, a pair of dragons and their kobold minions drove out the dwarves. Forty years later, the Crimson Swords—a famous adventuring band—slew the dragons and brought forth a great treasure from the ruined hold.
- **DC 15**: Adventurers sometimes go south to find and explore Vongyth in hopes of recovering lost treasures. Few return and it is assumed they never find the hold or that something terrible yet lurks in the dwarves' fallen home.
- **DC 20**: Before his death, Valentin Ironwolf—enticed by the stories of the dwarves' treasure—was said to have been planning an expedition to Vongyth. Some say he'd even found an old map or two of the place.

# <span id="page-64-0"></span>TH E SHUNNED VALLEY

# <span id="page-65-0"></span>TH E ADVENTURE BEGINS

The adventure begins with the party in the town of Dulwich. The Shunned Valley of the Three Tombs lies about a day's journey to the south.

#### ABOUT THE SHUNNED VALLEY

Hidden deep in the forest lies a marshy, sodden valley. Woodsmen and hunters shun this place, kept away by rumours of a terrible beast lairing within and of a ghost haunting the valley's boggy mere. But, as well as great danger, treasures, magical and mundane, lie unclaimed in the valley, for two unexplored tombs, built by ancient hands, and a small cave complex stand amid the mud and reeds.

# ADVENTURE HOOKS

Before play begins, have each character make an Intelligence check and consult "Valley Lore" to determine what they know of the place. These checks simulate the knowledge the characters have picked up while in Dulwich. Such knowledge—of a nearby site of adventure—might be enough to spark their interest in the valley and its tombs. If not, use one (or more) of the hooks presented below to propel them to the valley.

- **Aila's Fate**: One or more of the characters want to determine Aila's fate. Perhaps they are distantly related to the lost adventurer, have been hired by someone to do so or are merely curious. To use this hook, you must also run the optional encounter "Dead Aila".
- **Missing Woodsman**: A young boy, barely ten years old, approaches the party. The boy, Jani Ahokas, tells the characters of his father, Taisto, who recently disappeared into the woods near the valley. Taisto hasn't been seen for almost a week, and Jani is worried about him. He offers the party his father's meagre savings (mixed coinage worth 35 gp) if they find him.
- **Rival Sages**: A learned sage, Ilari Sianio (N male old human **noble**), is embroiled in an argument with a rival, Ulpa Varala (LN female middle-aged human **noble**), over the origin of the tombs in the valley. Ilari hires the party for 100 gp to investigate the valley and learn more about the tombs' origin. He'd also like any artefacts the party finds in the tombs. Meanwhile, Ulpa has hired other adventurers (see "Rival Adventurers") to secure the same proof; groups will likely meet in the valley.

# VALLEY LORE

A character making an Intelligence check may know something about the Shunned Valley. A successful check gains all the information revealed by a lesser result.

- **DC 5**: The valley lies a day's journey into the forest. No proper paths head in that direction, but game trails crisscross the surrounding area.
- **DC 10**: A pool—Aila's Mere—fills much of the valley. Named for an adventurer who drowned therein long ago, it is a marshy, boggy place.
- **DC 15**: Three tombs are said to lie in the valley itself. They are variously thought to be the resting place of ancient and savage barbarians, forgotten kings, or even the burial site for the chieftain of a long-extinct hobgoblin tribe.
- **DC 20**: A decade ago, a party of adventurers lost several members in the valley. The survivors buried their friends there before leaving the area.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

A character can use Charisma in Dulwich to gather information about the Shunned Valley and its tombs. Doing so takes 1d4 hours and requires a DC 10 check. A character exceeding this check gains one additional rumour for each 5 points by which they exceeded DC 10. Use the list below to determine what the character learns.

- 1. The ghosts of those buried in its tombs haunt the valley. They prey on travellers and explorers—many of whom do not return to tell of their adventures. (False rumour.)
- 2. Something large and predatory lives in the valley. The few woodsmen who go near the place have reported finding its leavings—droppings, half-eaten animals and so on. None have seen the beast itself.
- 3. Something terrible lives in Aila's Mere. Aila was a brave and skilled adventurer—how could such a person merely drown? Something must have dragged her into the pool.
- 4. The valley's tombs have never been opened—who knows what lies within?
- 5. The valley is very boggy. In some places, the mire acts like quicksand and can suck explorers down to a terrible death. (False rumour.)
- 6. The stories about terrible things living in the valley are rubbish. The place was explored, and its tombs were looted long ago; there's no point going there. (False rumour.)

# <span id="page-66-0"></span>GETTING T O THE VALLEY

The adventure begins with the party in the town of Dulwich. The valley lies five miles to the south in the midst of a dense forest. No pathways lead to the valley, but a network of game trails crisscross the area. Going is difficult and slow:

- **Speed 30 ft**.: A group moving at a base speed of 30 feet takes four hours to reach the valley (assuming they do not get lost or delayed).
- **Speed 20 ft**.: A group moving at a base speed of 20 feet takes six hours to reach the valley (assuming they do not get lost or delayed).
- **Getting Lost**: For every hour of travel in the woods, the party might get lost. Have the character most skilled in Wisdom (Survival) make a DC 14 Survival check to avoid this fate. Getting lost wastes an hour of the party's time.

#### MINOR EVENTS

For every hour of travel, roll on the list below for a minor event or discovery:

- 1. The wind sighs through the branches, causing them to clack together like the demented chattering of some ancient, primaeval woodland spirit.
- 2. A small, non-hostile woodland animal such as a rabbit, squirrel or fox bursts from the undergrowth. The animal appears skittish and flees the party's presence.
- 3. A small clearing wreathed in wildflowers makes an excellent campsite, a good place to rest or somewhere to get one's bearings. It is peaceful here.

- 4. A wide, dense swath of brambles and bracken bars progress. Detouring around the area adds one hour to the party's journey.
- 5. A steep-sided, 15 ft. deep gulley with a stream cuts across the party's path. It takes an hour to find an easy place to cross. Alternatively, the characters can scale the gulley's sides with DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks.
- 6. An old campsite stands in a clearing by the path; the camp's fire pit contains cold ash and is partially covered by blown leaves. Bits and bobs of discarded (and now worthless) equipment are scattered about the area.
- 7. Far off in the forest, the sounds of something large moving through the bushes reached the characters' ears. After a few minutes, the sounds fade away.
- 8. Thick clouds pass before the sun, plunging the forest into gloom. After a half-hour, the sun re-emerges.
- 9. A fallen tree lies half-sunken into the forest floor. Great stands of mouldy leaves lie piled about, and mushrooms grow thickly upon its rotten trunk.
- 10. Trees grow thickly together, plunging the forest floor into perpetual gloom. Here, the undergrowth is sparse, and the going is easier.
- 11. The half-eaten, rotting corpse of a deer lies in a pool of gore. Something large clearly worried the corpse. Other, smaller creatures—foxes and suchlike—have also subsequently feasted upon the corpse.
- 12. Large clawed tracks mar the ground. A DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals the creature was Large—about the size of a bear—and bipedal. (These are the tracks of the adult owlbear lairing in the Shunned Valley.) The tracks lead in the general direction of the valley.

# <span id="page-67-0"></span>TH E SHUNNED VALLEY AT A GLANCE

Several noteworthy locations lie within the Shunned Valley. Present the Player's Map to facilitate play here.

*A shallow valley lies amid the trees. A wide mere, fringed with reeds and rushes and fed by a waterfall, fills much of the valley floor. Three burial cairns lie to the east of the pool, while to the south, two lines of old statues lean drunkenly toward the sky.* 

#### A: BURIAL CAIRNS

Three stone cairns stand close to Aila's Mere.

*Three cairns of piled stones stand in a ragged triangle. Lichens and moss cover all three.* 

**Old Cairns**: Moss and lichen grow thickly on the piled stone cairns. The cairns are obviously old.

**Remains**: Each cairn holds the remains of a decade-dead adventurer. Much of their equipment has rusted or rotted away. However, perceptive characters taking the cairn apart may discover some small treasure; this takes four characters an hour. While doing so, a character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds something interesting. Use the list below to determine what they find. Use each entry only once.

- 1. A gold ring woven with silver wire (worth 50 gp).
- 2. A chipped ivory scroll tube decorated with once beautiful carvings of angels (worth 20 gp).
- 3. A rusty longsword (worth 30 gp) with a rearing wolf sigil on its pommel.
- 4. Six tiny azure blue translucent stones, each with a hole bored through the middle (azurites, each worth 10 gp).
- 5. A blunt and tarnished silver dagger (worth 22 gp).
- 6. A bronze cloak pin shaped like a dagger; usable as such by a Small-sized character (worth 20 gp).

#### B: WEATHERED STATUES

Six statues guard the entrance to location F—Champions' Rest.

*These weatherworn, moss-covered statues depict ferocious humanoid warriors. The warriors wear chainmail and hold a longsword grounded between their feet. One of the statues—the one nearest the pool—has fallen and lies in shards.* 

**Old Weathered Statues**: The statues depict hobgoblin warriors (DC 10 Intelligence determines).

**Broken Statue**: The fallen statue has half sunk into the boggy ground. Lichens and mould grow thickly upon it.

**Buried Skulls**: Characters digging below the statues discover an aged hobgoblin skull buried below each warrior. Buried to placate the tribe's war gods, each skull contains a small transparent yellow gem (a citrine worth 20 gp).

#### C: AILA' S MERE

This marshy pool fills much of the valley. Due to frequent flooding, the area surrounding the pool is boggy.

**Denizen**: A **giant frog** lurks here but has grown somewhat cowardly after several near-fatal encounters with the owlbear in location G. It attacks only when disturbed or when a tempting target is in the mere.

*A wide, marshy pool fringed with reeds and rushes dominates the valley floor. Boggy, marshy ground surrounds the pool.* 

**Calm Water**: The water is calm (DC 10 Strength [Athletics]), cold, and murky. Within 10 feet of shore, the mere is two feet deep; further out, it is five feet deep. Cloying three-foot-deep mud and silt comprise the pool's bottom.

**Boggy Ground**: The ground surrounding the pool is boggy. This does not inhibit movement, but the wet ground makes this an unpleasant place to camp.

**Frog's Lair**: The giant frog's noisome lair is hidden in the reeds. Partially eaten fish, bones and excrement dot the area.

#### D: WATERFALL

Here, a small waterfall tumbles into Aila's Mere (location C).

*A waterfall tumbles into the valley over a series of three cascades before flowing into a wide, marshy pool.* 

**Rough Water**: In the immediate vicinity of the waterfall, the water is rough (DC 15 Strength [Athletics] navigates).

**Noise**: The continuous roar of falling water imposes disadvantage on hearing-based Wisdom (Perception) checks within 20 feet of the waterfall.

#### E: TOMB O F THE STONE WOMAN

Filled with fearsome traps, this tomb has not been opened since it was sealed long ago.

*A moss-covered capstone blocks a narrow fissure in the rock. Swamp grass grows thickly over the boggy ground.* 

**Development**: Proceed to "E: Tomb of the Stone Woman".

#### F: CHAMPIONS ' REST

Herein lie two hobgoblin heroes of old. This tomb has not been disturbed since it was sealed…and one of its inhabitants is very, very hungry.

*A heavy capstone covered in verdant moss blocks what appears to be a passageway leading into the hill. Grass and weeds grow thickly about the entrance.* 

**Development**: Proceed to "F: Champion's Rest".

#### G: LAIR O F THE HUNTERS

An owlbear and its young lurk in these small caves. When the characters enter the valley, the adult owlbear is away hunting.

*A narrow crack—perhaps five-foot-wide—pierces the cliff. A faint carrion odour wafts from within. The ground is churned up around the entrance.* 

**Development**: Proceed to "G: Lair of the Hunters".

![](_page_68_Picture_0.jpeg)

# <span id="page-69-0"></span>VALLEY DRESSING

The characters are likely to spend quite some time poking about the valley. Whenever they search and don't discover anything noteworthy, roll on this list to add verisimilitude and a minor point of interest to the proceedings.

- 1. A large, mottled brown and white feather lies on the ground. The feather is obviously far too large to have come from a bird. This is an owlbear feather.
- 2. The obvious tracks of a large clawed bipedal creature mar the muddy ground.
- 3. The vegetation—reeds, rushes, or grass as appropriate—is crushed and broken. Something large obviously passed this way.
- 4. A loud, distinct splash comes from Aila's Mere. Ripples spread across the water, but their cause is unclear.
- 5. High up in the sky, a large bird circles the valley. After a few minutes, it dives into the grass, snatches a mouse and flies away to feed.
- 6. For a moment, the character catches the faint scent of carrion on the breeze.
- 7. A small patch of yellow and red wildflowers—incongruously grows amid the mud.
- 8. The wind picks up. For a moment, it sounds like the moaning of forlorn spirits.

# RANDOM ENCOUNTERS & EVENTS

To a certain extent, the characters determine the pace and direction of events in the valley. However, it's always good to throw some randomness into proceedings. Thus, during the characters' exploration of the valley, use the list below to spice up the adventure.

**Frequency of Checks**: You can roll every half-day, whenever the party exit a tomb or once a day. Make this determination based on the speed at which the characters are tackling the valley's adventure sites and the pace you want to set for the adventure.

- 1. Minor Event
- 2. Minor Event
- 3. Minor Event
- 4. Heavy Rain
- 5. Corpse in the Water
- 6. Wolf Pack
- 7. The Owlbear Returns
- 8. Rival Adventurers

#### 1-3: MINOR EVENT

To determine what minor event occurs, roll on this list:

1. A large crow flutters down and lands on one of the cairns (location A). It caws loudly and seems to peck at the rock. Unless disturbed, it continues doing this for about an hour before flying away.

- 2. A band of drizzle crosses the valley. The drizzle persists for 1d3 hours. Characters remaining outside during the drizzle eventually get wet. This has no in-game effects.
- 3. A head-sized rock loudly clatters down one side of the valley. It comes to rest in the marshy ground surrounding Aila's Mere (location C). There is no sign of what—or who—dislodged the rock.
- 4. A large branch tumbles down the waterfall (location D) and into Aila's Pool (location C). Its branches still bear green leaves. Eventually, it floats into the reeds to the west of the cairns (location A). Investigations reveal blood smeared on the branch.
- 5. The croaking of frogs from among the reeds surrounding Aila's Mere suddenly grows disconcertingly loud. If the giant frog is still alive, it joins in, adding a louder, deeper element to the chorus.
- 6. A flock of swallows wheels and dives across the sky in a complicated, mesmerising dance.
- 7. At dawn or dusk, a light mist rises from Aila's Mere (location C), cloaking the valley in its damp, ethereal embrace. The mist lingers until the next dawn.
- 8. The sound of something large roaring (or hooting if the owlbear isn't yet dead) reaches the characters' ears. The sound comes from the surrounding woodland…and is getting closer.

#### 4: HEAVY RAIN

It rains heavily and continues to rain for 2d6 hours. Characters without tents—or who don't take cover—get soaked and are (probably) miserable.

**Effects**: Heavy rain cuts visibility in half, Wisdom (Perception) checks and ranged attacks are made with disadvantage, unprotected flames are extinguished, and protected flames may be extinguished (50% chance).

#### 5: CORPSE I N THE WATER

Many foul things dwell and hunt in the surrounding forest. Several days ago, a goblin was slain, and its corpse fell into the river. Eventually, the body tumbles over the falls and into Aila's Mere (location C). Perceptive characters (DC 10 Wisdom [Perception] spots) notice it floating face down in the centre of the pool.

**The Giant Frog**: The giant frog—if still alive—also spots the corpse. It views the slain goblin as a tasty snack and attacks anyone entering the pool to retrieve it. The frog fights ferociously but retreats to its lair if reduced below 7 hp.

**Retrieving the Corpse**: If the characters retrieve the corpse, they discover it is battered and partially decomposed. The cause of death is impossible to determine, but the goblin still wears ragged leather armour and has a small shield strapped to its left arm. The shield bears the crude device of a moon dripping blood. This is the sigil of the Blood Moon tribe of goblins (DC 11 Intelligence reveals; a DC 16 check reveals the tribe are thought to lurk near Valentin's Folly—otherwise known as the Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands). The goblin has 13 sp in a sodden pouch.

# <span id="page-70-0"></span>6: WOLF PACK

Two **wolves** enter the valley searching for prey. Their scent ability gives them ample warning of something terrible lurking within location G, and they do not approach that cave. However, the rest of the valley holds no terror for them. If the giant frog is still alive, it flees into Aila's Mere (location C) and waits until the wolves leave (or are slain).

The wolves prefer to strike a lone or vulnerable target but might attack the party's camp if the encounter occurs at night. A wolf flees if reduced to less than half hit points. An injured wolf does not return.

#### 7: TH E OWLBEAR RETURNS

The **owlbear** lairing in location G returns to the valley. It enters the valley from the southeast on the north bank of the stream. Unless distracted or attacked, it drags its kill—a half-eaten deer—back to its lair (location G).

**The Young Owlbear is Dead**: The owlbear emerges from its den in a fury soon thereafter and rampages about the valley looking for revenge. Driven by rage, it attacks any creature it sees.

**The Young Owlbear is Alive**: The owlbear shares its kill and then sleeps until the next morning. Then, in the afternoon, it emerges to hunt again. If it spots the party, it attacks and fights until slain.

#### 8: RIVAL ADVENTURERS

A rival band of adventurers arrives in the valley, intent on exploring the tombs. They might be working for the sage Ulpa Varala (see "Adventure Hooks"). The group comprises:

- **Aelliah Uthliavar** (NE female elf; Appendix 1): This smoothtalking, beautiful woman has a cold, merciless heart.
- **Elir Garsten** (N male dwarf; Appendix 1): This dour, foulmouthed dwarf has a burning hatred for goblins and their ilk.
- **Helmi Ojanen** (NE female human; Appendix 1): Fascinated by how things work, Helmi lacks many social skills required for civilised society.
- **Vesa Takala** (NE male human; Appendix 1): Handsome and cold-hearted, Vesa is obsessed with magical power.

The group are black-hearted and cares nothing for any claim the characters might have over the valley.

**Tactics**: When the adventurers first meet the characters, they feign friendship, try hard to ingratiate themselves with their rivals, and appear as nonthreatening as possible. They set up camp at the opposite edge of the valley.

Their plan is simple. They don't see the point in breaking into these tombs when someone else will do it for them. Thus, they only attack once the characters have cleared out all three tombs (preferably when the characters are injured or as they rest overnight before leaving the valley).

#### AELLIAH UTHLIAVAR

*This slender elf's silver hair tumbles over her shoulders and her purple eyes seem alive with amusement.* 

This smooth-talking, beautiful elf has a cold, merciless heart.

**Personality**: Merciless and utterly self-obsessed, Aelliah delights in bending the weak-willed to her whims.

**Mannerisms**: Beautiful and graceful, Aelliah's rarely—if ever raises her voice.

**Distinguishing Features**: Aelliah's purple eyes constantly sparkle as if she is permanently amused.

**Background**: Exiled from her homeland after being caught blackmailing several men, she lusts for revenge.

#### ELIR GARSTEN

*This dwarf is wide and heavily muscled, and his thick black beard is neatly trimmed. He wears battered but serviceable scale mail and carries several weapons.* 

This dour, foul-mouthed dwarf has a burning hatred for goblins and their ilk.

**Personality**: Dour and foul-mouthed, Elir is a joy to be around. He blames the world for his status as an outcast.

**Mannerisms**: Elir is hard of hearing in his left ear; he cocks his right ear towards those speaking to him.

**Distinguishing Features**: Elir's left ear is crushed and broken the legacy of an ogre's club.

**Background**: Elir was banished from his home after he refused to serve in the militia. With nowhere to call home, he has wandered ever since.

#### HELMI OJANEN

*Lank brown hair frames this human woman's oval-shaped face.* 

Fascinated by how things work, Helmi lacks many social skills required for civilised society.

**Personality**: Abrupt and rude in manner, Helmi is not pleasant company. Fascinated with machinery and how it works, she is never happier than when tinkering with her latest acquisition.

Helmi is used to living rough—or at least from day to day. She is tough, resilient and self-sufficient. She greatly desires to accumulate enough coin to live a life of comfort and excess. In fact, she has already identified the house she plans to buy; she even occasionally breaks in to look around while the current owners slumber in their beds.

**Mannerisms**: Dextrous and possessing great coordination, Helmi often dances a battered copper coin—her lucky coin—across the knuckles of her left hand.

**Distinguishing Features**: Helmi rarely smiles; instead, her face seems locked in a perpetual grimace. Her attempts at smiling appear ridiculous in the extreme.

**Background**: Beaten as a child, Helmi distrusts everyone and hates being vulnerable—either emotionally or physically. She grew up in Dulwich and has had several run-ins with the law. There, she is known as a petty thief.

#### <span id="page-71-0"></span>VESA TAKALA

*Slender and pale-skinned skinned, this handsome man has a ready smile. He wears polished studded leather armour.* 

Handsome and cold-hearted, Vesa is obsessed with magic and power.

**Personality**: Driven to understand and control magic, Vesa is a fanatical follower of Morden the god of magic. Vesa senses some additional power within himself and is eager to understand them. Even though he plans to murder them, he will happily engage in hours of conversation about magic with any wizards or sorcerers he encounters.

**Mannerisms**: Vesa always smiles, no matter the situation. His grin grows truly wide when treasure is within his grasp.

**Distinguishing Features**: Vesa has perfect, white teeth (of which he is very proud).

**Background**: Both Vesa's parents had sorcerous abilities magic is literally in his blood. His mother was also a priestess of Morden and inducted him into the clergy as soon as he was old enough. He hungers for power and to surpass his hated parents' abilities.

# OPTIONAL ENCOUNTER: DEAD AILA

Use this encounter if the players are experienced or seem keen on roleplaying. Note that **Aila** is a potent foe for 1st-level characters, and if the group is prone to unrestrained violence, this encounter may go poorly (for them).

**What Has Gone Before**: Aila was a neophyte druid who, with her companions, stumbled into the valley while tracking an injured deer. While she examined the deer's tracks, the owlbear burst forth from its lair and surprised the group. It quickly killed three of the party and forced another to flee. Seeing all was lost, Aila retreated into the mere. The owlbear did not follow her but waited on the bank for her to emerge from the lake. Eventually, Aila tired and drowned, and the owlbear wandered off after savaging the three slain adventurers.

Once the owlbear left, the lone survivor returned and buried all the remains (location A) he could find. He couldn't find Aila—but had seen her enter the mere—and so named it in her memory. Her spirit has haunted its waters ever since.

![](_page_71_Picture_11.jpeg)

# MEETING AILA

If the characters spend some time poking about the mere, Aila becomes aware of them. She silently emerges from the water near the waterfall and floats across the lake to speak with them. Her ghostly appearance may cause panic among the adventurers:

*The ghostly, translucent figure of a woman— long black hair gently floating in the air around her—emerges from the turbulent water near the waterfall. Silently, she glides toward you.* 

Aila starts the encounter indifferent toward the adventurers. However, if they have obviously broken open the cairns of her fallen companions (location A) she is unfriendly.

- **Indifferent**: Aila asks the characters to recover her bones from the mere and then bury her near her slain companions. She can offer no physical reward but warns the party of the owlbear (location G) and giant frog (location C).
- **Unfriendly**: Aila demands the party rebuild her companion's cairns. Doing so—and acting apologetic—makes her indifferent toward the party.

**Personality**: Death has given Aila a new appreciation of nature and its beauty. She has taken great solace in watching the creatures—even the owlbear—living in and around the valley, and she has no desire to "leave."

**Distinguishing Features**: Aila's hair gently floats in the air about her head as if caressed by unseen (and unfelt) currents.

**Mannerisms**: Aila often seems to struggle for breath before speaking—this is a symptom of her death by drowning. She is touchy about this subject if the characters mention it.

# RETRIEVING AILA' S REMAINS

Aila would like to be laid to rest in a cairn alongside her fellow adventurers. If the characters retrieve her remains from the mere and bury them, award the party 350 XP. Aila thanks them for their efforts but can offer them no material reward.

Aila's mouldering corpse is buried in the mud and sludge at the bottom of the mere near the waterfall.

• **The Mere**: The water near the waterfall is ten feet deep and rough (DC 15 Strength [Athletics]). The waterfall churns up the muddy water, reducing visibility underwater to mere inches.

**Searching**: Finding enough of Aila's bones to satisfy the ghost is difficult. It takes a character able to swim 2d4 hours to retrieve the bones, but more than one character can search the lake. A character who fails to make a DC 15 Strength [Athletics]) check does not provide meaningful assistance.

• **Attack of the Killer Frog**: If the characters have not yet dealt with the giant frog lairing in the nearby reeds, their extended presence in the water draws it forth. Hungry, it decides to snack on an adventurer. It targets a character in the water. Once it has caught a snack, it drags its victim back to its lair.

# <span id="page-72-0"></span>E: T OMB O F THE S TONE WOMAN

This tomb, filled with fearsome traps, has not been opened since it was sealed centuries ago. Within lie the remains of an ancient hobgoblin wizard. She was both feared and respected by her fellows—hobgoblins tend to distrust "elf magic"—and so to keep her quiet in her grave, they built this elaborate tomb.

#### GENERIC TOMB FEATURES

The Tomb of the Stone Woman has these generic features:

**Illumination**: Darkness.

**Worked Stone Floor**: The stone floors are relatively smooth and free of obstruction.

**Dust**: Thick dust covers the floor. No tracks are evident.

**Worked Stone Walls**: The walls are smooth (DC 20 Strength [Athletics] scales) and covered in peeling yellowed whitewash. Faded murals showing hobgoblins in battle cover the walls. Some areas in the tomb have specific murals of interest; these are detailed in the relevant location descriptions.

**Stone Doors**: These doors are heavy and difficult to open (DC 15 Strength forces) but not locked.

**Ceiling**: The ceilings are of worked stone and roughly eight feet high.

# E1: ENTRANCE

A heavy capstone wards access to the tomb.

*Weeds grow thickly about this heavy moss-covered capstone.* 

**Capstone**: This capstone is heavy and difficult to roll aside (DC 20 Strength moves). It has a crude carving of an esoteric rune (DC 15 Intelligence [Arcana] reveals the rune means "danger") graven upon it.

# E2: DEATHTRAP CORRIDOR

This seemingly empty corridor is a death trap.

*Dust lies heavily on the floor here. Faded murals of hobgoblins in battle cover the walls.*

**Murals**: The niche opposite the entrance to E3 has a particularly lurid mural of a female hobgoblin calling down fire and lightning to slay her enemies.

**Traps**: Two traps—a collapsing ceiling trap and a poison gas trap that activates shortly after the ceiling collapses—ward this area.

• **Collapsing Ceiling Trap**: Part of the ceiling is rigged to collapse. When the door to E3 is opened, the ceiling above the square nearest the entrance collapses, sealing would-be robbers inside.

• **Poison Gas Trap**: Tiny holes pierce the corridor's walls. Six rounds after the ceiling collapses, poisoned gas starts to issue into the corridor.

#### E3: TH E LURE

This chamber is designed as a lure for the traps in E2.

*Three dusty chests stand in this small storage area. The middle chest is open, and within it lies a great mass of coins.* 

**Chest 1 (Locked)**: This old wooden chest is in bad condition but is locked (DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools unlocks). It contains mouldy (worthless) clothes of ancient cut. The chest has a shallow false bottom (DC 20 Wisdom [Perception] spots) containing six transparent red gemstones (jaspers, each worth10 gp).

**Chest 2 (Open)**: This open chest contains a mass (794 cp and 476 sp) of tarnished copper and silver coins. The coins are primitive things from kingdoms long since fallen into ruin.

**Chest 3 (Locked)**: This old wooden chest is in bad condition but is locked (DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools unlocks). It contains a carefully folded but mouldy and fragile black banner depicting a flaming lightning bolt. If roughly handled, the banner falls apart. A transparent pale blue stone (a tourmaline worth 250 gp) is hidden in its folds.

#### E4: TH E BAT TLE VAULT

Frescos on the walls here depict some of the hobgoblin wizard's greatest victories.

*Faded frescos depicting many battle scenes cover the walls. In all of them, a female hobgoblin is depicted annihilating her foes with lightning and fire.* 

**Frescos**: If a light source is in the room, a character making a DC 15 Wisdom [Perception] check notices some elements of the frescos glimmer and glitter. Investigation reveals the outlines of the wizard's spells are picked out with gemstone fragments. Characters spending an hour carefully removing these fragments gather gem fragments worth 25 gp.

#### <span id="page-73-0"></span>E5: CHAMBER O F LIVING STONE

Herein stands the Stone Wizard. Imbued with a fragment of the long-dead hobgoblin wizard's power, the statue is animate, and it attacks any and all intruders.

*A low, rough-hewn stone sarcophagus fills the centre of this chamber. Behind the sarcophagus, on a low stone plinth, stands the stone statue of a female hobgoblin clad in form-hugging robes.* 

**Denizen**: The statue—the **Stone Wizard**—depicts the ancient hobgoblin wizard. It stands upon a low stone plinth. The Stone Wizard steps down from its plinth and attacks when robbers defile the sepulchre by trying to force open the lid. It chases intruders but does not leave the tomb.

**Trap**: The round after the Stone Wizard steps down from her plinth, the dart swarm trap activates.

**Sarcophagus (External)**: This stone sarcophagus has a rough finish—as if the mason didn't finish the job. The lid is heavy (DC 18 Strength check opens). It shatters if pushed off onto the floor.

**Sarcophagus (Internal)**: A mouldering skeleton amid the decayed remains of once fine robes of an elder cut lies inside the sarcophagus. Amid the bones lies a plainly wrought silver dagger etched with mystical symbols that was the wizard's arcane focus. The bones also wear a set of rotting leather bracers decorated with gold and silver wire worth 25 gp.

**Sarcophagus (Underneath)**: The sarcophagus hides a stone trapdoor which protects the entrance to the Dread Shrine of the Supreme Warlord. Characters searching the chamber may notice (DC 18 Perception spots) an intriguing groove in the floor next to the sarcophagus; this is an edge of the trapdoor. Dragging the sarcophagus aside reveals the trapdoor.

# F: CHAMPIONS ' REST

Herein lie the remains of two hobgoblin heroes—Craz and Drezna —of old. This tomb has not been disturbed since it was sealed… and one of its inhabitants is very, very hungry.

# GENERIC TOMB FEATURES

The Tomb of the Champions' Rest has these generic features:

**Illumination**: Darkness.

**Worked Stone Floor**: The stone floors are relatively smooth and free of obstruction.

**Dust**: Thick dust covers the floor. No tracks are evident.

**Worked Stone Walls**: The walls are smooth (DC 20 Strength [Athletics] scales) and covered in peeling and yellowed whitewash. Faded murals cover some of the tomb's walls. The relevant area descriptions detail specific murals of interest.

**Stone Doors**: These doors are heavy and difficult to open (DC 15 Strength forces) but not locked.

**Ceiling**: The ceilings are of worked stone and roughly eight feet high.

# F1: ENTRANCE

A heavy capstone wards access to the tomb.

*A large capstone wards access to whatever lies beyond. It bears a worn and moss-spattered depiction of two warriors lying side by side on a stone bier.* 

**Capstone**: This capstone is heavy and difficult to roll aside (DC 20 Strength moves).

#### F2: HALLWAY

This hallway is unoccupied.

*A dusty corridor ends in a stone door roughly 50 ft. away.* 

**Illumination**: Dim light fills the corridor when the capstone at location F1 is rolled aside.

**Faded Mural**: A mural of two hobgoblin warriors surrounded by piles of slain foes decorates one wall.

#### F3: SLEEPLESS MINIONS

Goblin slaves were left here to serve their masters in death.

*Three burial niches pierce this short corridor's walls.* 

**Denizens**: Three **tomb guards**—undisturbed for centuries—lie here. They animate when intruders reach location F2.

**Burial Niche**: Covered in dust, each niche bears faded pictures of goblin warriors depicted in ferocious poses. There are no grave goods in the burial niches.

#### F4: EMPTY CHAMBER

Intended as a burial chamber, this room was never finished.

*The walls of this chamber have been hewn from the rock but not whitewashed like the others.* 

**Carven Walls**: The walls are of undecorated worked stone.

#### F5: SHIELDS O F THE FALLEN

This room displays battle trophies taken by Craz and Drezna.

*Dusty shields and timeworn banners hang from the walls here.* 

**Faded Murals**: Murals of battle cover the walls. Each of the banners and shields hanging here are cleverly woven into the scenes—in which hobgoblins are winning every encounter.

**Banners**: The banners are ancient tribal devices; none of the tribes survive to the present day. However, a sage interested in such matters (or a noble trying to increase their house's standing) might pay 100 gp for the collection.

#### F6: LAIR O F THE FALLEN

Herein rest Craz and Drezna. Lovers in life they rest together eternally. Horrifyingly, Drezna—depraved in life—rose as a ghoul and was so hungry she gnawed the decomposing flesh from her lover's bones.

<span id="page-74-0"></span>*A wide stone bier stands in the centre of this chamber. Faded murals cover the whitewashed walls.* 

**Denizens**: A **tomb guard** attends **Craz** and **Drezna**. All three are ready for combat. Craz and Drezna view the tomb guard as expendable but aid each other in battle.

**Stone Bier**: A three-foot-high, ten-foot-wide stone bier stands in the centre of the chamber.

**Faded Murals**: Murals cover the walls of the chamber. One scene depicts two hobgoblins during an act of love, another shows them using skulls as drinking cups, and a third shows them surrounded by slain enemies.

**Treasure**: The two champions carry the only treasure here. Refer to their stat blocks for more information.

# G: LAIR O F THE HUNTERS

An owlbear and its young claim this small cavern complex. Luckily, when the characters arrive, the adult is away hunting.

#### GENERIC CAVE FEATURES

The caverns have the following generic features:

**Illumination**: Darkness.

**Stench**: The smell of wet fur, rotting flesh and faeces pervades this cave complex.

**Floor**: Covered in rubble and the remains of the owlbears' hunts, the floor throughout the lair is difficult terrain. Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks are made in the cave with disadvantage.

**Remains**: The remains of dozens of creatures—wolves, deer, foxes and other woodland beings—cover the floor. Some are little more than skeletons; others yet rot. A DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals all were killed by something clawed and immensely strong.

**Walls**: Climbing the cave walls is easy (DC 15 Strength [Athletics] scales). In several places, the owlbears have sharpened their claws on the walls, leaving deep scrape marks in the rock.

**Ceiling**: Small stalactites hang from the ceiling. The ceiling varies in height between five and ten feet.

**Natural Stone Steps**: These natural stone steps are difficult terrain. Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks are made on the stairs with disadvantage.

#### G1: ENTRANCE

Beyond this narrow entrance lies the owlbears' lair.

*The stench of carrion, wet fur and other unwholesome smells emanate from this narrow cave mouth. Bones and chunks of unidentifiable meat lie just beyond the entrance.* 

**Tracks**: A character searching around the narrow crack who makes a DC 5 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies the tracks of a large clawed creature entering and exiting the cave. A DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals the presence of an additional smaller set of tracks among the larger tracks.

**Illumination**: Dim light from outside pervades the first 30 ft. or so of the cave. Beyond, darkness reigns.

**Fur & Feathers**: The adult owlbear squeezes through this narrow passage. Consequently, clumps of fur and feathers are stuck to the walls. A DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) identifies these as coming from an owlbear.

# G2: HALL O F RUIN

This corridor comprises the "spine" of the complex.

*The passageway widens to perhaps 20 feet in places. To the right, a set of natural steps disappears down to a lower level. Further on, an escarpment drops away to another cave.* 

**Escarpment**: A 20 ft. high escarpment provides access (DC 10 Strength [Athletics] scales) to location G5. The smell of excrement wafts up from the bottom of the escarpment.

#### G3: OWLBEAR NURSERY

One young owlbear lurks in the nursery, noisily consuming a wolf's corpse. Luckily for the characters, it is distracted by its meal (it has disadvantage on Perception checks) and may not notice them.

• **DC 5 Wisdom (Perception)**: The character hears crunching bones and tearing flesh coming from the cave.

*Hunched in a corner lurks a bizarre half-bear, half-owl monstrosity the size of a grown man. It greedily tears at a dripping chunk of flesh it holds in its claws.* 

**Denizen**: When it notices intruders, the **young owlbear** hoots loudly and attacks. It fights savagely and to the death.

**Nest**: A pile of broken tree branches, rotting flesh and cracked bones in one corner is the young owlbear's nest.

**Shattered Egg**: The shards of two large shattered eggs lie about. Mixed in with the detritus of the nest are the skeletal remains of a tiny owlbear.

![](_page_74_Picture_33.jpeg)

<span id="page-75-0"></span>![](_page_75_Picture_0.jpeg)

# G4: OWLBEAR NEST

Herein, lairs the adult owlbear.

*The stench in this chamber is almost overpowering. A large pile of tree branches forms a noisome nest while the remains of various animals are scattered about.* 

**Large Nest**: The owlbear's nest comprises a pile of broken tree branches, rotting flesh, and cracked bones. Mixed in with the detritus are a human's gnawed remains.

• **Dead Hunter**: These are Taisto Ahokas' remains (see "Adventure Hooks" for more information). Wearing a tattered cloak and hunter's clothes this human male has been partially eaten. He has 15 sp and 3 gp along with a small potion vial containing effervescent red liquid (a *potion of greater healing* in a blood-stained pouch. He also has a dagger hidden in his boot (DC 15 Wisdom [Perception] finds).

#### G5: CAVE O F BATS

Hundreds of bats live among the stalactites here.

• **DC 5 Wisdom (Perception)**: The terrible smell emanating from this chamber differs to that found elsewhere in the caves.

*Stalactites grow thickly on the roof of this high chamber. Piles of rank-smelling guano cover the floor.* 

• **DC 14 Wisdom (Perception)**: If a character looks into the cave, they spot scores, if not hundreds, of tiny bats hanging upside down among the stalactites.

**Denizens**: Countless bats slumber among the stalactites. If they are attacked or a bright light is brought into the cave, they for a **swarm of bats** and attack.

**Stench**: The smell of excrement fills this chamber.

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is 30 ft. high and festooned with stalactites. Creatures among the stalactites gain half cover (+2 AC, +2 Dexterity saves).

**Guano**: Piles of guano cover the floor to a depth of about one foot. A character searching the guano who makes a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers some skeletal remains. Searching characters must also make a DC 10 Constitution save or contract a disease.

• **Skeletal Remains**: Buried beneath the guano lies the broken body of a dwarf killed by a falling stalactite. Much of his equipment is ruined, but a character searching the remains finds a heavy warhammer, the head of which is engraved with lightning symbols. The dwarf also possesses four small yellow transparent gemstones (jaspers, each worth 50 gp) and 14 sp, 13 gp and 2 pp.

#### <span id="page-76-0"></span>DREAD SHRINE O F THE SUPREME WARLORD

The entrance to the Dread Shrine lies under the sarcophagus in location E5.

Centuries ago, the powerful hobgoblin warlord Morg Drolak dominated much of the land that would become the Duchy of Ashlar. However, like all living things, eventually, he fell—whether to time's remorseless onslaught or a foe—history does not record. His followers built him a subterranean shrine and tomb to celebrate his glory and his devotion to Malbut, the greater god of hobgoblins, bravery, war and conquest. They hid the place below a simple tomb for one of Morg's concubines, and gradually, but inevitably, the place slipped from the memory of the world.

Nothing stays hidden forever, though.

#### MALBUT, THE LORD O F WA R

LE greater god of hobgoblins, bravery, war and conquest

**Epithets**: The Lord of War, Marshal of the Eternal Host, the Bloody Axe

**Symbol**: A double-headed battleaxe

**Domains**: Death, War

**Favoured Weapon**: Battleaxe

**Raiment**: Malbut's worshippers are never without their armour; even at rest, they wear studded leather armour. Hobgoblin warriors wear chain mail at the least, while champions and priests wear plate armour. Plate armour normally has Malbut's double-headed battleaxe engraved into its breastplate, while worshippers clad in chain cover it with a red or black surcoat similarly emblazoned.

**Worshippers**: Hobgoblins, hobgoblin warriors

**Teachings**: War is the natural state of things; diplomacy and compromise are the refuge of the weak. In discipline, there is strength. Obey orders. The strong take what they want, and the weak die. If a warrior must die, a glorious, brave death ensures their place in the Eternal Host.

**Holy Texts**: Malbut's faithful take their lessons from the *Book of War*. Each *Book of War* is different. While each book lists Malbut's core teachings, the faithful acknowledge that war is an ever-changing thing and that the tactics and strategy required for victory constantly evolve. Each church or tribe thus uses the book to record their victories and defeats and the lessons they learned from their struggles. Thus, does the faithful's knowledge of war and its practices evolve.

**Additional Notes**: Services to Malbut often feature the ritual killing of enemies captured on the battlefield. The faithful's bodies are burnt on pyres so that their spirits can join Malbut in his Obsidian Citadel.

**Temples & Shrines**: Malbut's temples and shrines are often underground and are always extensively decorated with battle booty taken from the hobgoblins' slain enemies. Images glorifying Malbut—ever triumphant—are carved into the walls; it is a great honour for a hobgoblin chief or warrior to be added to the carving as one of Malbut's warrior-companions.

# TH E ADVENTURE BEGINS

The characters may find the Dread Shrine of the Supreme Warlord while searching the Chamber of Living Stone (location E5) in the Tomb of the Stone Woman. If they fail to find it, use one of the hooks below to draw them back to the tomb (if you so desire).

- **Ancient Map**: During an adventure, the characters recover an ancient map from a monster's treasure hoard. The ragged map shows the location of "Drolak's Tomb". Deep in the wild woods, the tomb's isolated location presents the possibility that it has not yet been looted.
- **Getting Out of the Storm**: The characters are trapped in the Shunned Valley while a horrendous storm savages the area. They wait in the Tomb of the Stone Woman and while doing so, one of the characters notices the partial outline of what could be a hidden trapdoor under the tomb's sarcophagus.
- **Talkative Peasants**: The characters overhear two hunters talking about a recent discovery either they or an adventurer made. They talk about an unopened, secret trapdoor hidden in a looted tomb. They'll share the tomb's location for a fee.

# WHISPERS & RUMOURS

A character might know something about the Dread Shrine of the Supreme Warlord. Perhaps they are steeped in local lore. Alternatively, they may have heard a rumour about the place while drinking in a tavern or overheard two locals gossiping while browsing a marketplace.

Use this list to determine what the character knows:

- 1. In ancient times, a mighty hobgoblin warlord claimed much of the land that was to become the Duchy of Ashlar as his empire. History forgets his ultimate fate.
- 2. Hobgoblins once ruled the surrounding lands; every now and then, adventurers—or sometimes even peasants tilling their fields or collecting wood in the deep forests— come across old sites linked to the hobgoblins.
- 3. The mightiest of all the ancient hobgoblin warriors and warlords was Morg Drolak. His prowess was legendary. He was said to have even defeated death.
- 4. Hobgoblins worship Malbut, their Lord of War. Champions and chieftains are believed to join their patron's Eternal Host when they die.
- 5. Hobgoblins are the most martial and organised of the goblin races. Some tribes subjugate wide territories and gather much wealth and glory to their banners.
- 6. Morg Drolak—the mightiest of all the ancient hobgoblin warlords was buried in a secret tomb which has never been found. It is bound to be stuffed full of antiquities and treasure!

(Not all the rumours above may be true; determine the veracity of the information based on your vision for the Dread Shrine.)

#### <span id="page-77-0"></span>NOTABLE LOCATIONS AT A GLANCE

The dungeon has several notable locations.

- 1. **The Forgotten Entrance**: This passage is the only entrance to the Dread Shrine of the Supreme Warlord.
- 2. **Antechamber**: Carvings on this chamber's walls show Malbut's Invincible Host striking down a horde of orcs.
- 3. **Western Processional**: Replete with statues of long-dead hobgoblin champions and a pair of sarcophagi (one holding a skeletal warden), this corridor runs almost the entire length of the shrine.
- 4. **The Flooded Font**: Fed by a natural underground spring, this font leaks after heavy or sustained rainfall.
- 5. **Eastern Processional**: This corridor hides a secret door.
- 6. **Chapel of War**: Two animate guardian axes ward this sacred chamber. They attack anyone coming within five feet of the dais who does not bear Malbut's sigil.
- 7. **Secret Chamber**: This secret chamber and its attendant secret doors (see locations 5 and 6) enabled the shrine's priests to enter the chapel without raising the portcullis.
- 8. **The Grand Processional**: In this corridor, the hobgoblins' heroic dead were cheered a final time before they were interred in the crypts to the north.
- 9. **Chamber of the Sacred Axe**: Herein, the hobgoblins gathered to venerate Malbut's favoured weapon. A charnel guardian yet protects the chamber.
- 10. **Hall of Victory**: This chamber is the antechamber to the Necropolis of Heroes (location 11) and the Warlord's Rest (location 12). Here, the hobgoblins gathered to chant the many victories of their buried warlord.
- 11. **Necropolis of Heroes**: Four zombie hobgoblin warriors rest in their sarcophagi, waiting for Morg Drolak, to call them to once again march forth to war.
- 12. **Warlord's Rest**: Here, amid the dust of ages, Morg Drolak awaits Malbut's call.

# GENERIC DUNGEON FEATURES

Many of the dungeon's locations share certain features:

**Illumination**: Darkness.

**Ceilings**: The arched ceilings are ten-foot-high in the corridors and most of the chambers.

**Stone Walls**: The walls are of dressed stone (DC 20 Strength [Athletics] scales) in fair condition. In places, moss and lichen grow on the walls, and water oozes through the crumbling mortar.

In corridors, iron torch sconces are set every 20 feet on opposite walls. Most sconces are empty, rusty and dusty.

**Flagstone Floor**: The floor's flagstones have started to shift and move under time's remorseless influence, but generally, they do not inhibit movement.

**Wooden Door**: Warped and rotting wooden doors (AC 13, hp 15, immune to poison and psychic damage; DC 15 Strength opens) open into the room or space beyond. Most are in a poor state of repair. A locked door can be opened with a DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone using thieves' tools.

**Stone Steps**: The flights of stone steps in the shrine are well crafted and count as difficult terrain.

#### DUNGEON DRESSING

Use this list to breathe life and detail into the dungeon:

- 1. Deep dust lies on the floor; nothing has passed this way for many long centuries.
- 2. Dust-wreathed cobwebs hang from the ceiling, creating grey curtains that undulate slightly as the sluggish air flows through the tomb.
- 3. Water oozes through cracks in the wall to drip onto the nearby floor. Thick greyish sludge covers the damp section of the floor.
- 4. Cold, dirty water drips from a crack in the ceiling.
- 5. Drifts of dust have accumulated against the walls.
- 6. Dusty grey cobwebs hang from the ceiling and waft gently as the characters pass underneath.
- 7. A flagstone rocks slightly under a character's foot.
- 8. Scattered rubble, issuing from a small collapse in a wall, lies across a small section of floor.
- 9. A faint breeze ruffles the characters' hair; it comes from the direction of location 1.
- 10. A faint moaning sound fills the air—outside, powerful winds batter the valley.

# THINGS TO FIND

Use this list to determine what minor objects or features of interest the party find if they search a dungeon location. Modify the value of items found to suit your campaign.

- 1. This small golden broach—perhaps once used to secure a cloak—is wrought in the shape of a spear.
- 2. Three thin golden coins lie amid the dust. Their designs are worn away, and they are little more than golden disks.
- 3. Scratches on the wall in Goblin spell out the message, "All Hail the Lord of War".
- 4. An old, dusty battleaxe leans against a wall.
- 5. The brittle, charred stub of a torch lies amid the grime.
- 6. A single worn silver coin lies amid the dust.
- 7. A flagstone rocks under a character's foot; underneath it, a small hollow hides a silver battleaxe unholy symbol.
- 8. This tiny stone figurine of a hobgoblin warrior is missing its left arm (and weapon).
- 9. Scraps of rotting tapestry are scattered across the floor; a few gold and silver threads, however, have survived time's remorseless onslaught.
- 10. An iron dagger of exceptional strength and sharpness is stuck into a crack in the wall; only its worn handle is visible, so deeply is it buried.

# <span id="page-79-0"></span>1: TH E FORGOTTEN ENTRANCE

This passage is the only entrance to the Dread Shrine of the Supreme Warlord.

*A narrow set of stone steps descends steeply into darkness. Stalesmelling air wells up the stairs.* 

**Stone Trapdoor**: The stone trapdoor is heavy but has a thick iron ring set at its centre. It has not been raised for centuries (DC 20 Strength opens).

**Stale Air**: Stale-smelling air wells from the passage below the trapdoor once it is opened.

**Stone Stairs**: The stone stairs descend for about 30 feet; they are difficult terrain.

**Iron Portcullis**: This rusty but still strong iron portcullis (AC 19, hp 40, damage threshold 10, immune to poison and psychic damage; DC 23 Strength lifts; a Small creature squeezes through with a DC 20 Dexterity check) wards access to the Chapel of War (location 6). It has not moved for centuries. If a character lifts it and does not wedge it in place, it immediately falls back into its original position.

# 2: ANTECHAMBER

Carvings on this chamber's walls show Malbut's Invincible Host striking down a horde of orcs.

*Intricate, low-relief carvings shrouded in dust and spider webs cover the walls of this small, square chamber.* 

**Bas-Relief Carvings**: The carvings depict an epic battle between an iron-shod hobgoblin army—the Invincible Host—and an orc rabble. Throughout the carvings, the hobgoblins are shown slaughtering the orcs. An observant character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a small section hidden away near the floor in which a hobgoblin depicted fleeing the battle is cut down by one of its fellows.

#### 3: WESTERN PROCESSIONAL

Replete with statues of long-dead hobgoblin champions and two sarcophagi, this corridor runs almost the entire length of the Dread Shrine.

*Two niches in the passage's western wall hold statues of hobgoblin warriors. A third niche holds a sarcophagus, while a fourth holds nothing but a pile of rubble and bones.* 

**Foes**: A skeletal warden lurks in the intact sarcophagus; it attacks anyone opening the sarcophagus.

**Southern Statue**: This stone statue depicts a proud hobgoblin warrior wearing ornate but archaic plate armour and holding a battleaxe grounded before it. The warrior wears a closed helmet.

![](_page_79_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Viewing Slit**: This viewing slit is designed to allow those not allowed into the chapel to gaze upon the services held therein. The viewing slit provides three-quarters cover (+5 AC, +5 Dexterity saves). Small-sized characters can squeeze through the slit with a DC 15 Dexterity check. Medium-sized characters must make a DC 20 Dexterity check to squeeze through. (Note, however, it may be impossible for bulky characters or those wearing rigid metal armour to squeeze through.)

**Sundered Sarcophagus**: A pile of bones, rusting armour and rubble is all that remains of a plain stone sarcophagus and its honoured occupant. The pile fills the niche and is difficult terrain. Nothing of value remains in the pile.

**Intact Sarcophagus**: This plain sarcophagus (DC 15 Strength opens) holds the skeletal remains of a hobgoblin priest—he was one of the Dread Shrine's wardens and yet watches over the fane in death as a skeletal warden. The warden attacks as soon as the lid of the sarcophagus is opened. While it stands in the sarcophagi, it has half cover (+2 AC, +2 Dexterity saves).

**Northern Statue**: This stone statue depicts a snarling hobgoblin warrior wearing plate armour with a raised battleaxe above its head—as if ready to strike. If a light source is present, a character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notes the hobgoblin's brown eyes glimmer. Investigation reveals the statue's eyes comprise small translucent brown stones (jaspers, each worth 50 gp).

# 4: TH E FLOODED FONT

Fed by a natural underground spring, this font leaks after heavy or sustained rainfall.

*A large, roughly wrought stone font stands in the centre of this small, square chamber. Much of the floor here looks damp.* 

**Flooding Font**: The mortar holding the font together has failed over the long centuries. After heavy or sustained rainfall, water oozes through the cracks between the stones and onto the floor.

**Slippery Floor**: The floor around the sundered font is slick and slippery; it is difficult terrain.

#### 5: EASTERN PROCESSIONAL

This corridor hides a secret door.

*Darkness fills this dusty and cobweb-shrouded narrow corridor.* 

**Viewing Slit**: This viewing slit is designed to allow those not allowed into the chapel to gaze upon the services held therein. The viewing slit provides three-quarters cover (+5 AC, +5 Dexterity saves). Small-sized characters can squeeze through the slit with a DC 15 Dexterity check. Medium-sized characters must make a DC 20 Dexterity check to squeeze through. (Note, however, it may be impossible for particularly bulky characters or those wearing rigid metal armour to access the chapel in such a fashion.)

**Secret Door**: A secret door (DC 20 Wisdom [Perception] finds, DC 15 Intelligence [Investigation] locates the door's mechanism—a slightly raised piece of flagstone) pierces the west wall of this area.

# <span id="page-80-0"></span>6: CHAPEL O F WA R

This chamber is sacred to Malbut.

*A raised dais set with two altars and a bronze statue of a huge hobgoblin clad in war gear dominate this shrine. Carvings of war decorate the walls. An iron lever juts from the east wall.* 

**Foes**: Two animate guardian axes ward this sacred chamber. They attack anyone coming within five feet of the dais who does not bear Malbut's sigil.

**Ceiling**: The arched ceiling is 20 feet high in the centre of the room and about 15 feet high where it meets the walls.

**Low Dais**: A five-foot high dais edged with three broad steps is the chapel's focal point. The steps are difficult terrain.

**Statue of Malbut**: This 12-foot-tall old bronze statue is a tribal relic. It depicts the hobgoblin god, Malbut, the Lord of War (LE greater god of hobgoblins, bravery, war and conquest), in all his martial glory. He is depicted wearing ornate plate armour and wielding a battleaxe. The statue can be scaled with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

**Western Altar**: Images of warrior hobgoblins decorate this altar. A battleaxe—a guardian axe—lies atop it next to a beaten silver tray (worth 50 gp).

**Eastern Altar**: An ancient flag—faded and stained by time—is draped over this altar. A battleaxe—a guardian axe—lies atop it next to an oversized, ceremonial silver goblet of simple design (worth 50 gp).

**Carvings**: Low-relief carvings depicting arrayed ranks of hobgoblin warriors worshipping Malbut decorate the walls.

**Secret Door**: A secret door (DC 20 Wisdom [Perception] finds, DC 15 Intelligence [Investigation] locates the door's mechanism pushing in the head of a battleaxe in a nearby carving) pierces the chapel's north wall.

**Portcullis Mechanism**: This iron lever controls the portcullis to the south. It is rusted and stuck in place with long disuse and requires a DC 15 Strength check to first operate. Once operated, the characters hear clanking for about one minute before the portcullis ponderously rises.

#### 7: SECRET CHAMBER

This secret chamber and its attendant secret doors (see locations 5 and 6) enabled the shrine's priests to enter the chapel without raising the portcullis.

*Dust lies thickly about the floor of this small chamber. Two rusting iron levers jut from the room's walls.* 

**Iron Levers**: The levers are rusted and stuck in place with long disuse. When first used, the lever of an unopened door requires a DC 15 Strength check to operate.

**Alcoves**: These two alcoves each hold high relief carvings of hobgoblin war priests clad in all their finery. Both individuals are depicted as heavily scarred; one has lost an eye. Both are wearing ceremonial plate armour and carrying large battleaxes.

# 8: TH E GRAND PROCESSIONAL

In this corridor, the hobgoblins' heroic dead were cheered a final time before they were interred in the crypts to the north.

*A stone door with graven words upon it pierces the north wall of this curved corridor. A huge carving of a hobgoblin war host carrying their dead toward a series of immense burial cairns decorates the walls.* 

**Carven Stone Door**: This stone door (AC 17, hp 20, damage threshold 8, immune to poison and psychic damage) is heavy and hard to force open (DC 20 Strength succeeds). The carving on the doors says, in Goblin:

#### *"Beyond Lie the Lord of War's Heroic Dead. Disturb Them Not."*

**Bas-Relief Wall Carvings**: The impressive and intricate carvings decorating these walls show a hobgoblin host carrying their war dead toward a series of immense burial cairns. A character making a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices that a particularly ornate sarcophagus carried by six warriors leads the procession.

**Tapestry**: A tapestry depicting yet another scene of heroic battle—in which hobgoblins slaughter an army of dwarves and elves—hides the entrance to the Chamber of the Sacred Axe. A character physically examining the tapestry automatically discovers the entrance; other characters who make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notice something odd about how the tapestry is hanging.

A character behind the tapestry is heavily obscured. Characters can scale a tapestry with DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks; however, a tapestry only supports 130 lbs. of weight. (Common sense suggests the tapestries are unlikely to support heavy climbers.) Heavier characters rip the tapestry from the wall once they have climbed ten feet; such climbers suffer 1d6 damage and land prone.

**Secret Door**: Two secret doors (DC 20 Wisdom [Perception]

#### <span id="page-81-0"></span>9: CHAMBER O F THE CLEAVING AX E

Herein, the hobgoblins gathered to venerate Malbut's favoured weapon. A charnel guardian—wrought as a huge axe-shaped statue**—**protects the chamber.

*A man-sized stone statue of a battleaxe stands behind an altar at the end of this roughly circular split-level chamber. Two short staircases provide access to the higher level, where tapestries decorate the walls, and four axe-shaped pillars rise to meet the lofty ceiling.* 

**Foes**: A charnel guardian protects this chamber. The charnel guardian animates five minutes after a living creature enters the chamber unless a battleaxe is placed on the groove in the altar. Placing a battleaxe in the groove after the statue has animated commands the statue to return to its plinth (unless it is subsequently attacked).

**Ceiling**: The arched ceiling is 25 feet high in the centre of the room and about 20 feet high where it meets the walls.

**Tapestries**: Tapestries depicting heroic hobgoblins, their heads bowed in prayer, decorate the walls of this chamber and the short passageway leading to it. A character behind a tapestry is heavily obscured. Characters can scale a tapestry with DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks; however, a tapestry only supports 130 lbs. of weight. (Common sense suggests the tapestries are unlikely to support heavy climbers.) Heavier characters rip the tapestry from the wall once they have climbed ten feet, fall prone and suffer 1d6 damage.

**Tapestry Remnants**: The remnant of a tapestry lies on the floor in the northeast part of the chamber. Here, water oozes through a crack in the ceiling, and a remnant of sodden and slimy tapestry is all that remains.

**Stairs**: Two short flights of steep stone steps lead upward to a higher level, which stands about ten feet above the floor; the stairs are difficult terrain.

**Stone Pillars**: These slender stone pillars are styled like immense axes whose curved heads blend into the ceiling.

Characters in an adjacent square to a pillar gain half cover (+2 AC, +2 Dexterity saves).

**Statue**: This battleaxe-shaped carven statue—actually a variant charnel guardian—stands upon a low plinth at the southern end of the chamber.

**Altar**: This otherwise plain, severely hewn stone altar bears a battleaxe-shaped groove cut into its top. The altar is hollow, and a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a secret door in the side facing into the chamber. A subsequent DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that pushing in the door's top left

# AR E THOSE MUMMIES ?

The characters may panic when the mummified zombie warriors emerge from their various resting places if they mis-identify the undead as mummies. That's an intentional decision design to add excitement and a sense of danger to the encounter.

and bottom right corners causes it to spring open. Doing so releases a noisy cascade of old coins onto the floor.

• **Treasure**: The coin-hoard comprises 2,134 cp, 1,056 sp and 73 gp.

# 10: HALL O F VICTORY

This chamber is the antechamber to the Necropolis of Heroes (location 11) and the Warlord's Rest (location 12). Here, the hobgoblins gathered to glorify their warlord's many victories.

*Four man-high wrought iron candelabras stand about this room. An altar covered in the decaying flag or cloth fills a niche to the north. A battleaxe lies on the altar.* 

**Altar**: This plain stone altar is about three feet high and fills much of the niche in which it stands. The rotting scraps of a war banner once red and black but now mostly faded to grey—cover the altar. A battleaxe rests upon the altar.

**Iron Portcullises**: Rusty but still strong iron portcullises (AC 19, hp 40, damage threshold 10, immune to poison and psychic damage; DC 23 Strength lifts; a Small creature squeezes through with a DC 20 Dexterity check) wards access to the adjacent chambers (locations 11 and 12). They have not moved for centuries. If a character lifts a portcullis and does not wedge it in place, it immediately falls back into its original position.

**Wrought Iron Candelabras**: Four six-foot high wrought iron candelabras stand about this chamber. The candelabra closest to each portcullis features a clever, hidden mechanism which both anchors it to the floor and controls the nearby portcullises.

- **Is This a Trap?** A character investigating the candelabras who makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check understands what their mechanism will do. A subsequent DC 15 Dexterity check made by a character proficient with thieves' tool can modify this mechanism so that each candelabra only operates the nearest portcullis.
- **Opening the Portcullises**: Pushing a candelabra away from the nearby portcullis (DC 15 Strength check to first operate) causes both portcullises to slowly (and loudly) rise up into the ceiling. The portcullis nearest the pushed candelabra opens in 1d4+2 rounds, while the other takes an additional three rounds to open fully. Opening the portcullises awakens the undead in locations 11 and 12.

#### 11: NECROPOLIS O F HEROES

Four part-mummified zombie hobgoblin warriors rest in their sarcophagi, waiting for Morg Drolak to call them to once again march forth to war.

*Four intact sarcophagi fill niches cut into the walls of this chamber. A pile of rubble, bones, wisps of grey cloth and scraps of armour fills a fifth niche.* 

**Foes** Four part-mummified zombie hobgoblin warriors rest in the sarcophagi. They awaken two rounds after the portcullises start to rise or when the sarcophagi are opened.

<span id="page-82-0"></span>**Tapestry**: A dusty and faded, brittle tapestry hangs behind the portcullis, obscuring an easy view of this room. It reaches to the floor and obscures all view of what lies beyond.

**Sarcophagi**: Four plain stone sarcophagi each fill a shallow niche. Each contains a zombie hobgoblin warrior.

**Rubble-Filled Niche**: Part of the ceiling has collapsed, and a pile of shattered rubble, broken bones, scraps of grey linen and the remains of a hobgoblin's battle gear fills this niche. The dusty pile is difficult terrain.

#### 12: WARLORD' S REST

Here, amid the dust of ages, the Warlord awaits Malbut's call.

**The Approaches**: Even when the tapestry over the entrance is moved aside, neither the altar, the statue, nor the urns are visible from the entranceway.

*A bronze statue covered in verdigris stands in a small niche in the north wall behind a plain stone altar. Four small urns stand on stone plinths carved from the chamber's south wall.* 

**Foes**: If the characters open the portcullis, the warlord, Morg Drolak, awakes. Sounds of nearby battle also bring him forth. Alternatively, he becomes aware of their presence once the characters enter the chamber through the secret door. After a few minutes, if he has not been discovered, he bursts forth to slay the interlopers. The guardian axe on the altar animates one round after Morg Drolak emerges from the statue.

**Tapestry**: A dusty and faded, brittle tapestry hangs behind the portcullis, obscuring an easy view of this room. It reaches to the floor and obscures all view of what lies beyond. Even when the tapestry is moved aside, neither the altar, the statue, nor the urns are visible from the entranceway.

**Altar**: An axe and a half-dozen skulls lie on the plain and austere altar (The axe is a guardian axe).

**Statue**: This hollow bronze, verdigris-speckled statue holds the part-mummified remains of the warlord, Morg Drolak. Morg can easily open the statue from the inside.

• **Treasure**: The warlord's half-plate armour, etched with a battleaxe sigil and curiously free of damage and rust, is still usable. It may have to be resized to fit a victorious warrior. (This costs between 10 and 40% of the armour's base value— 750 gp).

**Urns on Shelves**: Four small stone plinths carved from the

chamber's southern wall display a plain c e ra m i c u r n . E a c h u r n contains fine grey dust—the cremated remains

of one of the warlord's greatest enemies.

#### AFTERMATH

Once the characters have explored the Dread Shrine of the Supreme Warlord and dealt with its denizens, resolve the adventure hook(s) that brought them to the place.

If you used any of the hooks presented in "The Adventure Begins", use these notes to resolve the adventure's aftermath:

- **Ancient Map**: The ancient map the characters recovered could show other locales of interest or note; perhaps such are so faded that the characters only notice them once they again examine the map—perhaps idly by the fire one night while recovering from their adventure.
- **Getting Out of the Storm**: Once the storm has abated or moved on, and the characters have completed their investigation of the Dread Shrine, they can continue their onward journey.
- **Talkative Peasants**: If an adventurer found the trapdoor the peasants gossiped about, that individual (and their friends) would be less than pleased that the characters beat them to the tomb. If they discover the characters' identities, this could set up a minor rivalry between the two groups.

![](_page_82_Picture_21.jpeg)

# <span id="page-83-0"></span>C ONCLUSION

The Shunned Valley of the Three Tombs is an open-ended adventure site, and the party can leave the valley whenever they please. Once they have completed their exploration, they'll likely return to Dulwich to sell their loot and report to their employer.

- **Missing Woodsman**: Assuming they found his father's remains, Jani tearfully thanks the party and offers them the agreed reward. It should be blindingly obvious, however, to even the dimmest adventurer that if Jani pays them, he'll end up virtually destitute. If they refuse payment, award them 100 XP. In this instance, Jani begs them to let him come with them; he can't adventure, but he can tend their fire at night, cook, clean and so on. He forms a particularly strong bond with whichever character most strongly refuses payment.
- **Rival Sages**: Ilari Sianio pays the party the agreed 100 gp, if they provide credible information regarding the origins of the tombs in the valley. If they have done a particularly comprehensive job, he mentions that the ruin of Valentin's Folly lies in the woods to the southwest and that such a place might be of interest to adventurers like themselves. He adds that if the party discovers items of interest in the ruined keep, he might be interested in purchasing them.

# FURTHER ADVENTURES

While the party may have exhausted the possibilities for adventure in the Shunned Valley of the Three Tombs and the Dread Shrine of the Supreme Warlord, other adventure sites lie nearby. In particular, the ruined Valentin's Folly—otherwise known as the Shadowed Keep on the Borderlands—lies nearby. (The party may already be aware of the keep because of Random Event #5: Corpse in the Water.)

- **The Shadowed Keep**: A ruined monument to folly and ego, the Shadowed Keep (Valentin's Folly on the area map) stands atop an isolated bluff deep in a mist-wreathed forest. Sacked by marauding goblins and orcs decades ago, the place was thought abandoned, but shadows now creep among the forest's great boles and footprints have appeared on the overgrown, tenebrous track leading to the keep. Travellers have begun to disappear with alarming regularity from the nearby road and local folk fear some slumbering evil has claimed the ruin as its own.
- **Returning Hobgoblins**: Perhaps a local tribe of hobgoblins learn of the discovery of the Dread Shrine and claim it and the valley above as their new home. If the characters hear of this development they may feel obligated to meet and end this new threat.

# <span id="page-84-0"></span>TH E SHADOWED KEEP

# <span id="page-85-0"></span>AN OVERVIEW O F THE SHADOWED KEEP

Valentin's Folly is a small, simple fortification. Construction was never completed, and so it lacks many of the features of a more sophisticated, grander and better-financed fortress. It lacks a stout gatehouse, and the donjon never gained crenelations or much of an upper floor. However, although the keep appears like a ramshackle ruin, much of its structure remains intact.

- **Outer Walls**: Stout, crenellated outer walls protect the courtyard and donjon. A walkway, accessed by two stairs and from the watchtower, runs around much of the outer wall.
- **Courtyard**: The keep's muddy courtyard once held several wooden buildings, including a stable and smithy.
- **Tumbled Buildings**: All that remains are heaps of charred and rotten, moss-covered wood.
- **Tracks**: Tracks crisscross the courtyard; mainly, they lead between the donjon, the watchtower and the main gate.

#### TH E DONJON

This two-storey building is of solid construction, but even those with no engineering knowledge can tell the donjon was never completed. The building lacks crenelations, and several large stone blocks stand on the roof (presumably where Valentin's labourers left them when the money to pay them ran out).

Encounter areas in the donjon are prefaced with a D. Stat blocks for the donjon's denizens appear in Appendix 3.

# TH E WATCHTOWER

The keep has one watchtower. A small band of bandits claim the tower and guard it carefully against the Blood Moon Goblins lurking in the donjon's cellars. When they are not waging inconclusive war against the goblins, the bandits skulk in the surrounding woodlands waiting for foolish or unlucky travellers to blunder into their clutches. The human bandits never wander the woods at night.

Encounter areas in the watchtower are prefaced with a W. Stat blocks for the watchtower's denizens appear in Appendix 3.

#### TH E DONJON' S CELLARS

The Goblins of the Blood Moon claim the donjon's cellars as their lair. From here, they creep forth at night to hunt for food and victims and occasionally try to break into the bandits' tower.

Encounter areas in the cellars are prefaced with a M. Stat blocks for the cellar's denizens appear in Appendix 4.

#### TH E UNDERCRYPT

Encounter areas in this abandoned, undead-infested portion of the dungeons are prefaced with a U. Stat blocks for the undercrypt's denizens appear in Appendix 5.

![](_page_86_Picture_0.jpeg)

# <span id="page-87-0"></span>TIMELINE O F ADVENTURE

The Shadowed Keep is a dynamic living environment. Therein, the Blood Moon Goblins war with the bandits of the watchtower for control of the place, while within the goblins' ranks, the shaman Sar (M11) plots to overthrow his bestial chieftain.

Thus, when the characters arrive, each group is pre-occupied with defeating the other. When not fighting the characters, the bandits and the goblins don't simply sit around doing nothing. A few bandits might sneak into the woods searching for prey, while the goblins may launch a night-time attack on the bandit's tower.

#### EVENTS DAY B Y DAY

The following notes suggest a sequence of events you can use to bring the Shadowed Keep to life. You can follow the timeline below as detailed or simply pick and choose events that look interesting or that will enhance play. You can also use the events below as a way to give the characters experience points if they need a few more to level.

Some of these events happen at specific times, while others are triggered by the characters. The characters' actions, of course, might render some of these events moot; simply ignore or modify such events as required. For example, if the goblins attack the bandits' watchtower after the characters have killed all the bandits, the goblins will either fight the characters or ransack the tower (if the characters are elsewhere).

#### DAY 1

The characters arrive at the Shadowed Keep. Neither the goblins nor the bandits are aware of their presence (unless random encounters in the surrounding woodlands dictate otherwise).

That night, the goblins launch a raid on the bandits' tower. A group of six **Blood Moon warriors** led by **Razogen**, Ruknar's son, sneak out of the donjon and try to burn down the tower's front door. The goblins fail and withdraw when two of their number are

# CUSTOMISING EVENTS

You'll know how fast your players will likely explore the Shadowed Keep. If your players are the type to cautiously explore the place over several weeks or months, you might want to slow down the pace of the events detailed above so they don't all occur while the party are off resting elsewhere.

Conversely, if you want to emphasise the low-grade conflict between the goblins and brigands, have the bandits approach the characters for aid as soon as they reach the Shadowed Keep. Most groups are much more likely to aid the brigands than the goblins. However, for fun you could also have Sar approach the characters with his proposal as soon as is practicable. Such interactions give the characters a real sense of the antipathy between the goblins and the brigands; clever players will find a way to exploit this!

slain by bandits hurling down chunks of masonry into the courtyard from the tower's roof.

#### DAY 2

A light drizzle greets the dawn. Around midmorning this turns into a downpour that lasts for most of the day. For the next two days the stream connecting W2 and M2 is a raging torrent; travel along its course is impossible.

#### DAY 4

Three **brigands** led by a **veteran brigand** emerge from the woods and return to the watchtower. If they discover it sacked (or in the hands of the characters), they loot what they can and flee. If not, they reinforce their fellows and can be found in location W5.

#### DAY 5 (NIGHT)

Four hungry **wolves** enter the courtyard. They scratch at the door of the watchtower but do not enter the donjon.

#### DAY 6 (NIGHT)

Six **Blood Moon warriors** return to the tribe. Unless needed elsewhere, they lair in M7.

#### DAY 7

Three **brigands** led by a **veteran brigand** leave the tower in search of prey. They disappear into the woods and set up watch over the road to Dulwich. They return empty-handed (and in a foul mood) at sunset.

#### DAY 8

Gentle rain falls over the keep and its surrounds during the morning. It stops around midday, but the day remains gloomy.

#### DAY 8 [NIGHT]

Angered at continually being stuck in the kitchen, **Bareli** (location W4) gathers her treasure and deserts the brigands, slipping out of the tower at dusk. She immediately makes a run for the woods, trusting to her darkvision to see her through. She avoids contact with the characters if she can help it and flees to Dulwich. If she encounters the characters, she tries to strike a bargain with them they let her go free in return for detailed information about the tower's defenders and so on.

#### DAY 9

Three **brigands**—bored by the drudgery of living in the tower decide to explore some of the donjon. They investigate locations D1 and D3i (where they find a be-gemmed dagger [result 11-15 on the random treasure table]) before losing their nerve when confronted by the **monstrous viper** in location D6 and returning to the watchtower.

#### DAY 10 (NIGHT)

**Ruknar** stirs himself from the company of his concubines and leads a dozen of his minions (nine **Blood Moon warriors** and three **Blood Moon bruisers)** in an assault on the watchtower. The goblins attack in the dead of night. Ruknar batters down the <span id="page-88-0"></span>tower's front door and the goblin warriors surge inside. They easily take the ground floor, but Firean is a skilled warrior and manages to keep the goblins contained downstairs. The goblins discover the prison in the basement and rescue Yar before brutally slaying Reithic.

By the time the goblins withdraw, dawn is breaking. Three **brigands** and six **Blood Moon warriors** lie dead.

**Note**: Be careful running this encounter if the characters have claimed the watchtower from the bandits. This is an incredibly tough encounter for a low-level group of characters; however, the watchtower provides significant defensive advantages. Even if the goblins get inside, they baulk at fighting their way up the stairs into the tower's upper reaches. Have them retreat when you deem the characters have done enough to break their morale.

#### DAY 12

A thick fog shrouds the area, providing concealment in the courtyard as obscuring mist. The fog burns off by about midday.

#### DAY 18

In the early morning, the bear living in the surrounding woods (see "Surrounding Territory") wanders into the courtyard, looking for food. It only fights if attacked or threatened.

# CHARACTER-TRIGGERED EVENTS

#### BANDIT PARLEY

If the characters investigate the ruined donjon without attacking the bandit's watchtower, the bandits notice the party's arrival. Realising the characters could be powerful allies in her battle against the goblins, Firean tries to enlist them to her cause.

She directs the sentries atop the watchtower to keep an eye out for the returning adventurers. When the party emerge from the donjon, the sentry hails them and also calls for Firean. She quickly climbs to the tower roof and negotiates with the characters for help eradicating the goblins. If the characters agree (and if she believes them), Firean allows them to rest in the watchtower between forays. Unless victory over the goblins is certain, she does not commit her forces to the attack.

Sadly (but unsurprisingly), Firean is unpredictable and greedy. Unless the characters seem content to leave the keep after defeating the goblins, she has her warriors fall upon them when they are sleeping, disorganised or otherwise distracted.

#### GOBLIN ATTACK

If the characters have made two forays against the Blood Moon, but have not yet slain Ruknar, the goblins organise a counterattack. At night, a large force led by Ruknar's son, Razogen (location M12), emerges from the cellars and falls upon the characters. If the characters are in the watchtower, the goblins attack both outside doors at once and try to burn their enemies out. If the characters are camping in the woods, the goblins surround their campsite before unleashing a hail of missiles.

#### SA R' S TREACHERY

After the characters' first successful foray into the Blood Moon's lair, Sar (location M11) realises they represent his best chance of getting rid of Ruknar. Accompanied by his two loyal guards, he creeps forth to negotiate with the characters.

Sar desperately wants to rule the Blood Moon tribe and agrees to practically anything to get what he wants. He can give the party full details of the cellars, explain where guards are set and so on. Of course, he doesn't want to stand by any agreement he makes and turns on his puppets as soon as is practical.

#### RIVAL ADVENTURERS

If you want to introduce an element of haste to the characters' exploration, you can have a group of rival adventurers arrive in the area. At first, these NPCs can linger at a local tavern, searching for information, interrogating locals and (possibly) even trying to get information out of the characters. (This warns the characters that rival adventurers may soon venture to the keep and gives them an impetus to speed up their own exploration.) If you want to build the rival theme further, engineering a barroom brawl between the two groups can be fun and a great change of pace.

When you judge the time right, the rival adventurers finally reach the Shadowed Keep and start poking around. Of course, they are somewhat more unsavoury than the characters and have no qualms about slaying the party for its treasure.

- **Kuura Otra** (NE male human **bandit captain**) wants gold—lots of gold. Kuura dreams of retiring and opening an inn. He loves bar-hopping, mainly to spy on potential future rivals, and is a borderline alcoholic. Perpetually dishevelled and pale-skinned, Kuura has deep bags under his eyes, which make him look sad. He is a merciless foe.
- **Noora Ilakka** (N female human **druid**) loathes the undead, viewing them as foul monstrosities that must be put down at all costs. Rabid, in her defence of nature, Noora has a onetrack mind and is utterly unable to compromise. She wears a thick bear-skin cloak no matter the weather or situation. With tousled brown hair, a deep tan and freckles, she is attractive and uses this to her advantage.
- **Samu Rauma** (NE male human **cult fanatic**) leads the group through dint of his cunning. In love with his intelligence, Samu views his companions as nothing but tools and won't risk his life to help them. Samu worships Braal and dreams of rising high in his shadowy lord's service.
- **Vilutar Toiva** (CN female human **berserker**) forgets herself in battle, falling into a frenzy at the first sight of blood. Vilutar is larger than life—she drinks, she carouses, and she slays. Life is good. Impetuous and supremely dangerous, she acts first and thinks last (if at all). With short-cropped hair, a tattooed neck and stocky figure, Vilutar is an imposing sight—particularly when drenched in her enemies' blood.

Not every encounter with this group must include all four adventurers. Each NPC has a challenge rating of 2; for low-level groups, such a fight would almost certainly prove disastrous.

# <span id="page-89-0"></span>WATCHTOWER O F THE BANDIT QUEEN

A small bandit gang claims the keep's watchtower. Led by the halfelf bandit queen **Firean Maiethil** (location W7) and her cowardly henchman **Cullen Asikka** (location W6), the brigands have had little success recently in their skirmishes with the Blood Moon goblins lairing in the chambers below the donjon. The goblins keep travellers away from the keep's immediate environs, and the brigands lack the numbers to crush the goblins. Firean dreams of defeating the goblins and claiming the whole fortress for her own. She plans to use the keep as a base from which to exert her will over the nearby villages. Soon, she will rule all Ashlar!

Most of the brigands within the tower are typically blackhearted but nondescript villains, but a few are worthy of note:

- **Bareli (W4)**: This half-orc woman is an army deserter, a terrible cook and a mean drunk. Firean sees her as a threat to her hold over the bandits.
- **Cullen Asikka (W6)**: Devoted to his dog, Fang, Cullen is a coward who flees if the brigands' cause seems lost.
- **Firean Maiethil (W7)**: With delusions of grandeur and the dream of making the Shadowed Keep the foundation of a kingdom forged in war and blood, Firean is the most dangerous of the tower's inhabitants.

All the stat blocks for the watchtower's denizens appear in Appendix 3: Watchtower Denizens.

#### ARCHITECTURE & ENVIRONMENT

The tower has the following general features.

**Ceilings**: The ceilings in the tower are 12 ft. high.

**External Walls**: Although of solid construction, the tower's outer walls have begun to deteriorate. Mortar between the great stone blocks has begun to flake away. The walls can be scaled with DC 20 Strength (Athletics) checks.

**Arrow Slits**: Arrows slits provide three-quarters cover and allow dim light to filter into the tower. Small-sized characters can squeeze through an arrow slit with a DC 15 Dexterity check. Medium-sized characters must make a DC 20 Dexterity check to squeeze through an arrow slit. (Note, however, it may be impossible for particularly bulky characters or those wearing armour to gain access to the keep in such a fashion.)

**Shuttered Windows**: Windows are normally open during the day (except in bad weather) but firmly shuttered at night.

**Spiral Staircase**: A spiral staircase (which is difficult terrain) links the tower's above-ground levels. Combatants on the stairs gain half cover against attacks from below.

**Internal Wooden Doors**: Unlocked wooden doors (AC 15, hp 20, immune to poison and psychic damage) ward most rooms. Doors open into the room beyond. A locked door can be opened with a DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools.

**Wooden Floor Boards**: The tower's first and second floors have wooden floorboards that creak when walked upon. The floorboards impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move quietly across such areas.

#### TOWER DEFENCES

Having fought several skirmishes with the Blood Moon goblins, the bandits have prepared defensive plans to fight off any intruders. Unless in use, external doors are barred day and night, and the bandits react quickly to repel any incursion.

If enemies are without, two **brigands** move to the tower roof and hurl stones down upon their enemies. The others hold the guardroom (location W1) as long as possible before retreating upwards. They tenaciously defend location W3, hurling stones down upon intruders daring the stairs. If intruders force their way into location W3, the brigands either flee onto the battlements via location W5 or retreat to the tower roof. If both Cullen and Firean have fallen or fled, surviving bandits flee or surrender.

# RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

The characters have a 1 in 10 chance of encountering some of the tower's denizens for every 10 minutes they remain in the watchtower. Each encounter can occur only once. If the creatures are defeated, remove them from the relevant encounter area.

#### **D20 LOCATION ENCOUNTER**

| 1-5   | W5 | A brigand visits W2 to draw water.                                         |
|-------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6-9   | W5 | A veteran brigand wanders the tower<br>looking for a gambling partner.     |
| 10-13 | W4 | Bareli carries a tray of food and drink to the<br>prisoners in W2.         |
| 14-16 | W6 | Fang (Cullen's beloved wolfhound)<br>wanders the tower looking for snacks. |
| 17-18 | W6 | Cullen decides to take Fang for a hunt in<br>the surrounding woodlands.    |
| 19-20 | W7 | Firean Maiethil makes a surprise<br>inspection of her troops.              |

#### WATCHTOWER KE Y

- **W1 Brigand Guardroom**: The gang keep a constant guard here, and the outer door is normally barred from within.
- **W2 Dungeon of the Bandit Queen**: The tower cellar doubles as a well room and prison.
- **W3 Hallway**: The tower's hall is a key defensive position for the bandits should intruders force their way into the tower.
- **W4 Kitchen**: **Bareli**—army deserter and terrible cook—lairs here.
- **W5 Barracks**: Here dwells the bulk of Firean's gang. The door leading to the battlements is normally barred from within.
- **W6 Cullen's Chamber**: The cowardly **Cullen** lives here with his beloved hound, **Fang**. Cullen flees if things seem grim.
- **W7 Chamber of the Bandit Queen**: The Bandit Queen's quarters hold most of the gang's loot. **Firean** can normally be found here unless she is leading her troops in the tower's defence.
- **W8 Tower Roof**: During the day, two **brigands** keep watch here. At night, the roof is deserted.

# W1: BRIGAND GUARDROOM

**Denizens**: This guardroom is always occupied. Two **brigand veterans**—Adhearn and Conn—keep watch here.

*A closed iron-bound door pierces the tower's wall. The door's sturdy wood bears signs of assault—it is pitted and splintered, and scorch marks mar its bottom portion.* 

**Investigating the Door**: A character making a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears murmured conversation behind the door. A character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check discovers Medium- and Small-sized tracks around the door. The tracks lead through the keep's gate or to the donjon (location D1).

**Breaking Down the Door**: The tower's iron-banded door (AC 17, hp 30, damage threshold 5, immune to poison and psychic damage, DC 25 Strength check opens) is barred from the inside. Attempting to break down the door automatically draws the attention of Adhearn and Conn. Two rounds after the party start battering down the door, the two **brigands** on the tower's roof (location W8) notice the commotion.

#### GETTING IN: VIOLENCE

If intruders try to break in, Conn dashes upstairs to alert his fellows while Adhearn flips over the table and loads their crossbows. Two rounds later, Conn returns, and they ready to shoot at the first intruder through the door. If this drops the attacker, the bandits fight on. If not, they drop their crossbows and retreat upstairs.

#### GETTING IN: GUILE & PERSUASION

The characters can use guile and cunning to get into the tower.

- **Adhearn** is a lazy, cantankerous drunk. He is on guard duty as punishment for falling asleep at his post several days ago. He is short-tempered and tired.
- **Conn** has known no other life. He dislikes Adhearn, and is a romantic who dreams of finding wealth and fame as well as love through his banditry.

**Deception and Persuasion**: The bandits are hostile to strangers and wary of anyone coming to the tower door. A character can bluff way into the tower with a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) or (Persuasion) check by convincing the brigands the group wants to join the band. Alternatively, a character can make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to pretend to be bandits returning from a foray into the woodlands.

**Outcome**: If the characters are successful, the bandits unbar the door and let them in. If the characters fail, the bandits refuse to open the door, and one goes upstairs to alert his companions to possible trouble.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Table and Bench**: A flagon of vinegary wine, two cups and a bunch of keys (for the cellar door, and cell door and manacles in location W2) lie atop the table. Flipped over, the table provides half cover.

**Locked Cellar Door:** This locked door wards the cellar.

#### <span id="page-92-0"></span>W2: DUNGEON O F THE BANDIT QUEEN

**Denizens**: This room served Valentin's followers as a prison and well room, and the bandits use it for the same purposes. Currently, two prisoners languish here.

*A wall of iron bars divides this small, dank chamber. Within the cell, a dwarf and a goblin sit manacled to the wall. A well, surrounded by a low wall, pierces the chamber's floor. Nearby lie several buckets attached to damp lengths of rope.* 

The brigands hold two prisoners here:

- **Reithic Yurgirn** (LN male dwarf) lusts for revenge against the brigands. He is a trader of dwarven weapons and armour, and is grateful to adventurers setting him free. Reithic's full stat block and roleplaying notes appear in Appendix 3.
- **Yar** (NE male goblin) speaks only Goblin and has been savagely beaten by the brigands who want information about the Blood Moon's lair. Yar's full stat block and roleplaying notes appear in Appendix 3.

When the characters enter the chamber, Reithic immediately calls out, asking to be released. Yar says nothing, sullenly observing intruders. The two are unhappy cell mates and spend much of their time insulting and threatening each other.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: Darkness fills the chamber.

**Well**: A crumbling 2 ft. high stone wall encircles the 20 ft. deep well. If a character sits or leans on the wall, it collapses; the character falls into the well and suffers 2d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 10 Dexterity saving throw negates the fall and damage). The well's rough-hewn walls (DC 15 Strength [Athletics] check scales) descend to a shallow stream flowing to the southwest (eventually intersecting location M2). The bandits (and goblins) are unaware of this connection.

**Cell**: Iron bars (AC 19, hp 18, DC 25 Strength check bends) pierced by a locked iron bar door (DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools unlocks) divide the room.

**Manacles**: Manacles (AC 19, hp 15, DC 20 Strength check breaks, DC 20 Dexterity check escapes or DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools unlocks) affixed to the wall keep Reithic and Yar apart.

#### W3: HALLWAY

If the bandits in W1 have alerted their comrades, the warriors from W5 make their stand here, hurling rubble and stones at intruders daring the stairs.

*A barrel full of rubble stands by the stairs. Several doors lead away from this hallway. The spiral staircase continues upwards.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Barrel of Rubble**: Alerted bandits throw these rocks down the stairs at intruders. A character struck by a rock suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 15 Dexterity save negates) as it tumbles down the stairs.

#### W4: KITCHEN

**Denizen**: An army deserter, **Bareli**, serves as the gang's cook. Bareli is a skilled soldier, and Cullen and Firean see her as a threat to their leadership; thus, they keep her here, trapped in drudgery.

**Door**: The kitchen door is shut but not locked. The smell of cooking emanates from behind the door.

*The smell of simmering stew fills the hazy air of this kitchen. A fat half-orc woman clad in food-splattered hide armour stands near a steaming iron cauldron.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Smoke**: A haze of smoke hangs in the air.

**Cauldron**: A large cast iron cauldron (containing simmering stew) hangs over a small fire. A character can kick over the cauldron with a DC 10 Strength check. The stew creates a 15 ft. cone of slippery floor. Characters within the cone suffer 1 fire damage from the scalding stew. Characters moving through the area must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or stop in the first stew-filled square they enter. A character failing the check by 5 or more falls prone.

**Boxes and Sacks**: The boxes and sacks contain basic foodstuffs—flour, hardtack biscuits, salted meats and so on.

**Barrels**: Two barrels (one half full) contain thin, watery wine (each worth 10 gp full). A third barrel contains 20 pints of lamp oil.

![](_page_92_Picture_27.jpeg)

#### <span id="page-93-0"></span>W5: BARRACKS

**Denizens**: Herein dwell the gang's rank and file. Normally, during the day, four **brigands** rest here. At night, off-duty brigands slumber here.

*This plain, unassuming chamber houses eight two-tier bunks.* 

**Diplomacy**: Unless the party has made a lot of noise fighting the bandits on the lower level, violence does not have to immediately ensue when they reach this chamber. A successful Charisma (Deception) or (Persuasion) check averts bloodshed, but the brigands send one of their number to fetch Cullen and Firean. The bandits are unfriendly and suspicious but assume the characters are meant to be here. If the characters render the bandits friendly, they win their trust and can learn the band's composition, brief details of Cullen and Firean and so on.

**Fighting**: Brigands fighting in this chamber are cornered and fight desperately. The bandits use the bunk beds as cover and unleash a barrage of crossbow bolts at anyone entering the chamber. If a chance to escape presents itself, a bandit takes it rushing out of the room and down the spiral staircase or out onto the battlements.

• **Bunk Beds as Weapons**: Characters may push over bunk beds (DC 15 Strength succeeds) onto their enemies, who are knocked prone and restrained unless they dodge out of the way (DC 10 Dexterity saving throw succeeds). A fallen bunkbed counts as difficult terrain.

![](_page_93_Picture_6.jpeg)

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: A lantern hanging from a hook on the ceiling lights this room. Sometimes, during the day, the brigands open the door leading to the battlements to let in light and fresh air.

**Bunk Beds**: Eight two-tier bunk beds stand against the walls. Some are obviously unused. Two small unlocked chests sit under each bunk bed. These contain the bandits' personal possessions, such as spare clothes and mundane equipment (flint and steel, spare pouches, and other odds and ends). A careful search may uncover items of note:

- **Chest 1**: A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a small opaque mottled deep blue stone (an azurite worth 10 gp) hidden in an empty wineskin.
- **Chest 3**: A DC 5 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a dark blue fur-lined cloak (worth 25 gp) carefully folded at the bottom of the chest.
- **Chest 4**: A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check uncovers a silver belt buckle (10 gp worth).
- **Chest 8**: A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a selection of ladies' silk under-things (worth 5 gp) stuffed into a pair of old boots.

**Iron-Bound External Door**: A sturdy barred iron-bound door (AC 17, hp 30, damage threshold 5, immune to poison and psychic damage, DC 25 Strength check opens when barred) provides access to the battlements.

# W6: CULLEN' S CHAMBER

**Denizens**: Firean's lieutenant, **Cullen Asikka**, dwells here with his beloved wolfhound, **Fang**.

**Door**: The door is shut but not locked.

*The musty smell of wet dog fills this small bedchamber. A bed stands against one wall; at its foot lies a pile of wet and muddy cloaks. A chest stands against the opposite wall.* 

Cullen is here if the characters have affected a relatively quiet approach to this floor. The craven rogue investigates any sounds of battle in the tower, and if all seems lost, he retreats to his chamber, barricades the door (DC 20 Strength check forces open), and gathers his treasures before tying a rope to his bed. He lowers his beloved Fang to the ground before fleeing.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: Windows allow light into the chamber during the day. At night, a lantern provides illumination.

**Bed**: This large bed is comfortably appointed.

**Locked Chest**: This chest (AC 15, hp 18, DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools unlocks) contains spare clothes and other mundane equipment as well as a small sack containing 327 cp, 39 sp and 33 gp.

#### <span id="page-94-0"></span>W7: CHAMBER O F THE BANDIT QUEEN

**Denizens**: This is **Firean Maiethil's** chamber, but she is unlikely to be encountered here as she vigorously conducts the tower's defence on the lower levels. If the characters defeat the bandits on the lower levels, Firean retreats to the tower roof with any survivors to make a last stand.

*This chamber feels lived in. A few papers lie scattered on a desk against one wall, while an unmade bed stands against another. Clothes are scattered on the floor and across a bearskin rug.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: A window allows light into the chamber during the day. At night, a lantern provides illumination.

**Bed**: This large bed is comfortably appointed.

**Table and Chair**: A few sheets of scattered paper and an inkpot and quill stand on the table.

**Bearskin Rug**: This worn bearskin rug smells musty. A character making a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a small gold ring (worth 50 gp) hidden deep in the bear's mouth. The rug is worthless.

**Unlocked Chest**: This chest contains Firean's spare clothes and mundane equipment along with a scrap of parchment (Player Handout 3), which shows the location of the fallen dwarven hold of Vongyth (see "Further Adventures" and below for more details).

**Locked Chest**: The chest (DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens) contains 430 cp, 126 sp and 32 gp as well as a set of silver cutlery (worth 50 gp), a *spell scroll of speak with animals* and a *spell scroll of chill touch*.

#### W8: TOWER ROOF

**Denizens**: During the day, two **brigands** keep watch from the keep's roof. At night, the tower is deserted except when the brigands expect trouble. Normally, the guards posted here are lazy and inattentive.

*The tower's battlemented roof is empty but for a battered flagpole.* 

The roof provides a marvellous view of the surrounding area and the ruined donjon.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

The tower is 40 ft. high. Characters falling from its roof suffer 4d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Flagpole**: This flagpole is 15 ft. high. Characters can stand in the same square as the flagpole, and it provides half cover.

**Rubble**: The bandits have stored rubble here to hurl down upon attackers' heads. Squares containing rubble cost 2 squares of movement to enter. Small pieces of rubble deal 1d6 damage, while larger pieces deal 2d6 damage on a hit.

**Crenelations**: The tower's battlements provide cover against attacks from below.

![](_page_94_Picture_19.jpeg)

# <span id="page-95-0"></span>TH E RUINED D ONJON

Much fought over and looted, the Shadowed Keep's donjon stands all but empty and abandoned. Vermin claim much of the place as their own. No one has explored the upper level for months because two **giant spiders** lair in the donjon's great hall.

The Blood Moon goblins occasionally poke about some of the unoccupied chambers in search of lost treasures, but the tribe has learnt to avoid the donjon's most dangerous occupants.

#### ARCHITECTURE & ENVIRONMENT

The donjon has the following general features:

**Ceilings**: The ceilings in the donjon are 12 ft. high.

**Illumination**: Darkness and shadow shrouds much of the ruined donjon.

- **Ground Floor**: During the day, areas on the ground floor with high, narrow windows or arrow slits are illuminated with dim light. Other areas are in darkness.
- **First Floor**: Most rooms on the first-floor benefit from at least one window and are flooded with bright light during the day. Windows provide half cover.

**Floor**: Rotting and splintered furniture, trash from previous explorations and so on litter some of the floor on both levels of the donjon. Treat such areas as difficult terrain.

- **Ground Floor**: The ground floor comprises flagstones.
- **First Floor**: The tower's first floor has wooden floorboards that creak when walked upon. The floorboards impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move quietly across such areas.

**External Walls**: Although of solid construction, the donjon's outer walls have begun to deteriorate. Mortar between the great stone blocks has begun to flake away. A character can scale the walls with DC 20 Strength (Athletics) checks.

**Arrow Slits**: Arrow slits provide three-quarters cover and only enable dim light to filter into the donjon's interior. Small-sized characters can squeeze through an arrow slit with a DC 15 Dexterity check. Medium-sized creatures must make a DC 20 Dexterity check to squeeze through an arrow slit. (Note, however, it may be impossible for armour-clad or particularly bulky characters to gain access to the keep in such a fashion).

**Spiral Staircase**: A staircase (which counts as difficult terrain) links the tower's above-ground levels. Combatants on the stairs gain half cover against attacks originating from below.

**Wooden Doors**: Unlocked wooden doors (AC 15, hp 20, immune to poison and psychic damage) ward most rooms. Doors open into the room they serve.

# RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

The characters have a 1 in 10 chance of a random encounter for every 10 minutes they remain on the ground floor. No random encounters occur on the upper floor (locations D11- D13) or in the lost treasure vault (locations D14 - D16). Each random encounter occurs only once. If the creatures are defeated, remove them from the relevant encounter area.

#### **D20 LOCATION ENCOUNTER**

- **D6 Lair of the Vipers**: A **monstrous viper** dwells here with her young.
- **D7 Kitchen**: This ruined chamber holds little of interest.
- **D8 Pantry**: Green and brown mould, along with a small mushroom colony, grows upon the floor of this small chamber.
- **D9 Buttery**: The skeleton of one of the keep's defenders and a small amount of treasure await discovery here.
- **D10 Great Hall**: Two **giant spiders** claim this sealed chamber.
- **D11 Einar's Bedchambe**r: The ghost of Valentin's slain son, **Einar Ironwolf**, lingers here.

# <span id="page-97-0"></span>DONJON DRESSING

Use this table to generate minor points of interest, as desired. Such features have little or no impact on play but serve to underscore the current state of the donjon.

# **D20 DRESSING**

- <sup>1</sup> The bones of a small animal (a rat, rabbit or similar) lie crushed on the ground.
- 2 A pile of leaves and other detritus covers the floor.
- <sup>3</sup> One or more old skeletons lie where they fell in battle, surrounding by mouldering, worthless equipment.
- 4 An old, dried spray of blood splatters on one wall.
- 5 Thick spider webs obscure the ceiling.
- <sup>6</sup> A smear of charcoal on one wall shows where someone extinguished a torch.
- 7 A shattered arrow lies on the ground.
  - Crudely drawn pictures—depicting battle and slaughter—
- 8 are daubed over one wall. They show small, goblin-like creatures killing humans.
- 9 The word "Danger" is scratched onto a wall in Common.
- 10 An empty potion vial lies hidden, under some debris.
- <sup>11</sup> Faint tracks on the floor (DC 20 Wisdom [Survival] check spots) hint at what lurks in a nearby chamber.
- 12 Scrapes and scratches—weapon strikes—scar a wall.
- <sup>13</sup> Gossamer wisps of spiderwebs, moving gently in the breeze, hang from the ceiling.
- <sup>14</sup> A damp patch mars a wall. The smell of damp mould pervades the area.
- <sup>15</sup> A small stand of mushrooms grow amid a pool of faint light filtering in from outside.
- <sup>16</sup> The remains of a rotting backpack lie on the floor. A rent in the pack shows where the owner was brutally stabbed.
- 17 The words, "Here fell Conrah" are scratched into the floor.
- <sup>18</sup> A faded bloody handprint decorates one wall. The print is small—around the size of a human child's (or a goblin's).
- 19 A rusting, broken crowbar lies amid the trash and detritus.
- 20 Shards of soft, rotten wood litter the floor.

![](_page_97_Picture_24.jpeg)

# D1: GUARD CHAMBER

A stout pair of double doors once warded the donjon.

*A set of low steps leads up to a wide doorway. Stout iron-bound doors once warded access to the donjon. Now, one hangs crazily from one hinge while the other lies upon the steps.* 

Beyond stand the remains of a guard chamber. When the characters enter the chamber, read:

*Beyond the ruined doors lies a disused, leaf-strewn chamber. Two doors and three corridors lead away from the room.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: Bright light fills the chamber.

**Graffiti**: Bored guards scratched crude graffiti into the chamber's walls. None is of immediate use to explorers, instead describing the sexual proclivities of certain folk.

# D2: SERGEANTS ' CHAMBER

**Denizens**: Sergeants of the guard once occupied this ruined chamber. Now, six **giant rats** dwell within. The rats have suffered terribly at the hands of the monstrous viper lairing in location D6 and thus are particularly alert.

*This small chamber is mostly empty. Two sagging and rotting beds stand against one wall. A pile of rotting wood and other detritus is piled on and under the beds.* 

The rats do not attack unless someone disturbs their nest. If forced into battle, the rats attack savagely, focusing their attacks on the intruder disturbing their home. They fight to the death but do not pursue intruders from the room.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Dilapidated Beds**: Two beds stand against one wall. Both are sagging and rotten; they collapse if any creature bigger than a halfling stands on them.

**Rat Warren**: The rats live in a filthy warren in and under the room's beds. The bodies of three discoloured dead rats lie in the warren. A DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals they were poisoned. A character investigating the corpses who makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers puncture marks piercing each body.

**Treasure**: The rats have unknowingly incorporated some treasures into their nest. A character making a Wisdom (Perception) check while searching the warren may discover some small treasures:

- **DC 15**: 15 cp and 12 sp.
- **DC 20**: A soft, black velvet pouch. The pouch needs a good wash but is worth 1 gp.
- **DC 25**: A teardrop-shaped silver earring (worth 5 gp).

#### <span id="page-98-0"></span>D3 (I – I V): PERSONAL CHAMBERS

These chambers once housed important folk. Now, nothing remains but wrack and ruin.

*Dust and rotten, shattered furniture cover the floor.* 

Looters, bandits and Blood Moon goblins have repeatedly searched these chambers; little of value now remains.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Ruined Furniture**: Ruined furniture—rotten and smashed—lies scattered about the chamber.

**Treasure**: A character making a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a trinket overlooked by previous explorers.

#### **D20 TREASURE** 1-5 Under a loose flagstone, the character finds a small mouldy pouch containing 7 sp and 1 gp. 6-10 Hidden in an old cloak's folds the character finds an opaque mottled blue gem (an azurite worth 10 gp). 11-15 Wrapped in a mouldering cloth, the character finds a dagger; tiny dark green opaque stones decorate its hilt (malachites; total worth 20 gp). 16-20 Under a slashed mattress riddled with mildew, the character finds a worn quiver holding four *+1 arrows* fletched with jet black feathers.

Each treasure can be found only once.

#### D4: STAIR O F THE BLOOD MOON

This staircase leads to the cellars claimed by the Blood Moon goblins (location M1).

*A fallen door lies across the corridor. Beyond the open doorway, a staircase leads down into darkness. Crude circular symbols daubed in dried blood decorate the wall on either side of the stair.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Exploding Door Trap**: The goblins have set a crude trap in front of the stairs by hiding two vials of alchemist's fire under the door lying across the entrance to the staircase. A character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices one end of the door is raised as if something rests underneath.

Unless a character specifies they avoid standing on the door when entering the stairway, they set off the crude trap. Characters setting off the trap suffer 2d4 fire damage and catch fire. They suffer another 2d4 fire damage at the start of each of their next turns. Such characters can make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

**Blood Moon Symbol**: A character making a DC 15 Intelligence check identifies the symbol as the device of the Blood Moon tribe.

**Staircase**: This staircase descends 20 ft. to the keep's cellars. The stair is oft-travelled by Blood Moon goblins; a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals scuffed muddy goblin tracks leading up and down the stair.

**Treasure**: If the characters deactivate the trap, they can recover two vials of alchemist's fire.

#### D5: ABANDONED ARMOURY

This oft-looted chamber was once an armoury.

**Denizens**: A small colony of spiders dwells in this chamber. Characters making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check see many of the creatures scuttling about. Although the spiders are not numerous enough to form a swarm, paranoid explorers may assume otherwise.

*Dusty, cobweb-shrouded empty racks line this chamber's walls.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Wooden Weapon Racks**: Cobwebs shroud the weapon racks.

#### D6: LAIR O F THE VIPERS

The goblins know of the vipers herein and avoid this chamber.

**Tracks**: A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check notes the faint marks of a slithering creature in the corridor outside this room.

**Denizens**: A **monstrous viper** lairs here with three **baby vipers**, amid a pile of smashed furniture. The adult snake ignores intruders unless they enter the chamber. If they do so, it slithers forth to protect its young. It attacks the enemy nearest to its nest, repeatedly biting until its foe collapses. The baby vipers hide in the nest and only strike if someone disturbs their lair.

*A large pile of smashed and rotten furniture stands against one wall. The remains of a collapsed chest juts from the mess.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Dust**: A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check reveals the faint marks of a slithering creature in the dust leading to and from the partially collapsed chest.

**Smashed Furniture**: A mass of broken, rotting wood stands against one wall. Squares containing smashed furniture count as difficult terrain. Snakes within the pile gain three-quarters cover.

**Nest**: A broken chest lies amid the vipers' nest. A character searching the nest must make a Perception check opposed by the young snakes' Dexterity (Stealth) c h e c k . I f t h e character fails to spot the snakes, they attack with surprise. If the character spots the snakes and retreats, they do not strike.

#### <span id="page-99-0"></span>D7: KITCHEN

During the keep's fall, those who worked here rushed to the Great Hall to aid in its defence (and died there).

*This area was obviously once a kitchen. A large soot-stained fireplace dominates one wall. Toppled tables surrounded by shattered crockery and rusting utensils lie about the room.* 

Like most of the donjon, this area has been thoroughly looted.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Toppled Tables**: Three toppled tables lie on the floor, surrounded by a mass of broken pottery and rusting utensils.

**Great Fireplace**: A huge fireplace, its walls blackened with soot, dominates the room.

Characters can scale the chimney to reach the donjon's roof (DC 10 Strength [Athletics] check succeeds). However, birds now nest in the chimney's upper reaches, and characters climbing the chimney startle them. A character startling the birds must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or slip 10 feet down the chimney (taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage) before catching themselves. Characters climbing the chimney get covered in old soot and pungent bird excrement.

# D8: PANTRY

This storeroom once held the fortresses' food supplies.

*Sagging shelves starting at waist height and reaching almost to the ceiling line this chamber's walls. Dust, cobwebs, and rotting food cover the shelves. Patches of green and brown mould, as well as small stands of mushrooms, cover the floor.* 

This chamber has been comprehensively looted.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Smell**: The faint stench of rotten food pervades the room.

**Mushrooms & Mould**: Green and brown mould and mushrooms cover the walls and shelves of this chamber; a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals they are harmless.

#### D9: BUTTERY

This storeroom held the fortress's supply of beer and wine.

**Door**: The door leading to this chamber has been hacked and battered down. Its rotten shards lie in the doorway.

*Smashed and broken barrels lie about the floor. Amid the shattered wood lie the skeletal remains of a humanoid.* 

During the keep's fall, one of the defenders locked himself in the buttery. While he survived longer than his brethren, eventually, the goblins and orcs battered down the door and killed him.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Smell**: The barely detectable odour of stale beer lingers in the air. **Skeleton**: The skeleton of a man-sized humanoid lies on the floor, surrounded by mouldering equipment. A DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals the remains are of a human who died from a heavy blow to the head. The skeleton still wears rotting leather armour, but its weapon is missing. A character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a small hidden pocket sewn into the leather armour containing 5 sp and 18 cp.

**Wooden Butts**: These large empty butts once held beer. The slight smell of hops and barley lingers in the air.

**Small Barrels**: These split and broken small barrels held wine. **Loose Stone**: A character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a loose flagstone. Below lies a small cavity containing a dusty bottle of brandy (worth 10 gp).

#### D10: TH E GREAT HALL

The Great Hall was the heart of the keep. Here were held revels and feasts to celebrate the Ironwolves' many victories.

**Denizens**: Claimed by a mated pair of **giant spiders**, the Great Hall is a charnel house strewn with bones. After discovering the spiders within, the Blood Moon goblins secured the doors by wrapping chains around their handles.

**Stout Chained Double Doors**: Stout, iron-banded double doors (AC 17, hp 30, damage threshold 8, immune to poison and psychic damage, DC 20 Strength check opens when chained) bar access to the Great Hall. A chain is wrapped around the doors' handles. If the characters are not trying to be stealthy when removing the chain, the spiders automatically hear them.

*Dust and cobwebs shroud this large chamber. Long feasting tables fill the main part of the room, and at the far end stands a dais with another table atop. Shadows wreath the high, web-shrouded ceiling. Bones and rusting equipment cover the floor.* 

When the characters enter the chamber, the spiders lurk in their web. Characters whose passive Perception score beats the spiders' Dexterity (Stealth) check (+7 modifier) notice the lurking danger. If the characters do not notice the spiders, the fell beasts strike when intruders reach the hall's midpoint.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

Ceiling: The ceiling is 20 ft. high. Thick six-inch wooden beams set in a "V" shape hold aloft the upper floor. A great mass of cobwebs obscure the beams. Burning the webs away (AC 10, hp 15, vulnerability to fire, immune to bludgeoning, piercing and psychic damage) fills the hall with smoke for 1d6 x 10 minutes. Creatures in the burning web suffer 2d4 fire damage. Burning the web causes the bodies within to plummet to the floor.

A character can traverse a beam with DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. Characters failing this check by 5 or more fall, but can attempt a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to grab the beam. Falling characters plummet to the ground and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. A character on the rafters can make its way to the six web-shrouded corpses.

**Chandeliers**: Two wrought iron chandeliers hang from the ceiling on thick iron chains. Wreathed in dust and webs, the chandeliers can be raised and lowered using chains. A character must spend an action to lower a chandelier. The chains are strong enough to hold up to 150 lbs. of additional weight. Characters raised on a chandelier can reach the rafters.

**Spiders' Web**: A great mass of webs covers the ceiling and serves as the spiders' lair. A creature entering a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn in such an area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. Restrained characters can spend an action and make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to escape.

A character making a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices several humanoid shapes wrapped within the webs.

- **Goblins (4)**: These partially eaten goblins have no treasure.
- **Human Bandit**: Dead but uneaten, this bandit has 1 gp and 14 sp in a worn belt pouch. He wears studded leather armour and has a longsword.
- **Elf**: This elf wears leather armour and carried two daggers. His pouch contains a vial of antitoxin and a set of thieves' tools. (If the body falls to the floor, the vial shatters.)

**Dais**: A two-foot-high dais stands at one end of the chamber. Here, Valentin, his family and favoured retainers feasted. The dais's shallow steps do not impede movement.

**Great Tables**: A character can jump atop a table with a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or clamber up by spending an extra five feet of movement. Characters under a table gain threequarters cover against attack from above.

**Bones**: When the donjon fell, the defenders made their final stand here. The bones and rusting equipment of the slain litter the floor. The floor is difficult terrain.

**Lost Treasures**: Characters searching the Great Hall and making a Wisdom (Perception) check may uncover a few small treasures amid the bones of the fallen:

- **DC 5**: One of the human skeletons was obviously the focus of many attacks; its skull has been cleaved several times by cutting weapons, and several other bones are broken. (These are Valentin Ironwolf's remains.)
- **DC 10**: Every minute of searching uncovers 1d4 gp worth of mixed coinage. Characters spending more than ten minutes searching find no more coins.
- **DC 15**: A bone scroll tube stoppered by black, smoothed river stones. Investigation reveals the scroll tube to be watertight. The tube contains a *spell scroll of identify*.

**Faded Tapestries**: Faded, cobweb-draped tapestries showing scenes of battle and slaughter cover the walls. Characters can scale a tapestry with DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks; however, a tapestry only supports 130 lbs. of weight. Heavier characters rip the tapestry from the wall once they have climbed 10 ft.; such climbers suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage and land prone.

**Wooden Door**: An unlocked wooden door provides access to a dusty spiral staircase leading to the keep's upper levels.

![](_page_100_Picture_14.jpeg)

# <span id="page-101-0"></span>D11: EINAR' S BEDCHAMBER

This chamber belonged to Einar Ironwolf, Valentin's young son.

**Door**: The door to this chamber stands slightly open. As they approach, characters with a passive Perception score of 11 or more hear sobbing coming from this chamber.

**Denizen**: During the keep's fall, **Einar Ironwolf** was slain here, but his spirit lingers on, unable to find rest until he is laid to rest with his parents. He is not immediately hostile to intruders, but if they attack him, he fights back. He cannot leave the chamber.

*Dust shrouds this obviously looted bedchamber. The small skeleton of a child lies sprawled among the ruin. Above the skeleton hovers the translucent figure of a young boy, his spectral face streaked with tears.* 

If the characters attack Einar, he screams loudly and rushes at them, using his withering touch to slay his tormentors. Consumed by the sorrow and horror of his fate, he fights until destroyed.

#### SPEAKING WITH THE DEAD

A homely, shy child in life with a love of knowledge, Einar is now wracked by grief; nearly driven insane by the terror and pain of his last few minutes among the living, he craves to rest alongside his parents. To simulate his state of mind, treat him as hostile toward the characters (but he does not attack without provocation).

**Goal**: Einar wants his bones and those of his parents to be laid to rest together. He senses the necrotic taint in the undercrypt and does not want to be buried there. Valentin's bones lie in the Great Hall (D10), while his mother's lie in her bedchamber (D12).

**Reward**: If the characters agree to Einar's request, he tells them his father hid his treasure behind a secret door (D16). He does not know exactly where the door is, but he knows from overhearing his parents speak of it that it lies somewhere on this floor. He also tells them his father often boasted of the terrible guardians watching over his treasure.

If the characters lay the family's bones to rest together, award them each 50 XP.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Bed**: The moulding sheets and mattress have been viciously slashed. A large dried bloodstain covers much of the bed.

**Skeleton**: The skeleton is of a young human child of about ten years old. A DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals deep gashes in his vertebrae that suggest someone sawed at his throat with a jagged blade.

#### D12: BEDCHAMBER

This was Valentin's and Kaarina's bedchamber. Refer to D14 for details of the secret trapdoor set in the floor against the east wall.

*What was once an opulent bedchamber is now a shattered wreck. Dust lies thickly, and scorched, broken furniture is scattered about. A skeleton lies on the bed, and several more blackened skeletons lie by the door.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Skeleton**: The skeleton on the bed is Kaarina's. On the night the keep fell, Kaarina fought by her husband's side until he was struck down. She fled here to gather her possessions and son, but before she could reach Einar (D11) she was cornered and killed.

A DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals the skeleton on the bed to be of a human female killed by a caved-in skull. She wears mouldering, blood-spattered clothes that were once high quality.

**Blackened Skeletons**: A character examining the blackened and scorched skeletons by the door making a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check identifies them as two goblins and an orc.

**Secret Trapdoor**: A character making a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check spots this extremely well-hidden secret trapdoor. If Einar has told the characters of the secret door's existence, the characters have advantage on checks made to find the door.

#### D13: AUDIENCE CHAMBER

Here, Valentin met privately with trusted henchmen and close friends and plotted his conquest of the surrounding area.

*A large table and six chairs dominate this chamber. Against another wall stands a dusty desk, its drawers pulled out and smashed on the floor. Mouldering paper surrounds the desk.* 

This area has been looted, but not as comprehensively as other parts of the keep, and a few treasures remain. Additionally,

> this chamber makes an excellent place to rest as the large table can be used to barricade the chamber's door.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Large Table**: A character searching around the table who makes a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a secret compartment in one of its stout legs. Within lies a plain, wickedly sharp dagger in a leather sheath. Silver wire cunningly sewn into

the sheath depicts the Ironwolf family crest. The dagger and sheath are worth 5 gp.

**Loose Floorboard**: A character searching the desk who makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a loose floorboard beneath the desk. A small niche under the floorboard holds a mouldering, spider-web coated pouch containing 25 gp.

![](_page_102_Picture_0.jpeg)

# <span id="page-103-0"></span>L OST TREASURES O F THE IRONWOLVES

Valentin Ironwolf dug this small sub-level to hold his wealth. Only Valentin and his wife knew of the sub-level's entrance, and thus, after the Shadowed Keep's fall, it remained undisturbed.

#### ARCHITECTURE & ENVIRONMENT

The sub-level has the following general features:

**Illumination**: Darkness.

**Ceilings**: The ceilings are eight feet high.

**Flagstone Floor**: The floor's flagstones have started to shift and move under time's remorseless influence, but generally they do not inhibit movement.

**Stone Walls**: The walls are of dressed stone (DC 20 Strength [Athletics] check scales) in fair condition.

# D14: SECRET STAIR

This secret spiral staircase leads to location D15.

*A three-foot wide stair spirals downwards into darkness. Thick dust cloaks the floor, and dusty curtains of thin spider webs hang from the low ceiling.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Ceiling**: Beyond the secret door, the ceiling is barely six feet. high. **Spiral Staircase**: A steep, three-foot-wide staircase spirals downwards to Valentin's secret treasure vault. The stairs are difficult terrain. Combatants on the stairs gain half cover against attacks originating from lower down the stairs.

**Thick Dust**: Thick dust lies on the stairs. A character making a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can confirm that nothing has come this way in decades.

#### D15: TH E DEMONIC DOOR

No one has entered the corridor since the keep's fall

**Trap**: Several traps ward the Demonic Door. A hidden portcullis in the ceiling lurks at the bottom of the stairs (see "Portcullis Trap") while a magical fire trap and a **fire elemental lesser guardian** wait in the carven demon mouth (see "Demon Breath Trap").

*Flickering torchlight fills a corridor at the bottom of the narrow stairway. A stout wooden door flanked by brightly burning torches bars further progress. Above the door, a horrible carving of a demon's face leers down at you.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: Two torches, each treated with a *continual flame,* fill the corridor with bright light.

**Ceiling**: The arched ceiling is seven feet high above the centre of the corridor.

**Demon Face Carving**: Intricately carved, the demon face above the door represents no commonly known demon or devil (DC 15 Intelligence [Arcana] check confirms). The mouth is hollow.

- **Lever**: A character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a small raised piece of rock (a lever) at the back of the demon's throat. Moving the lever raises or lowers the portcullis (as appropriate). Once the stone is pressed, the mouth springs shut (+6 to hit, one target, 11 [2d10] bludgeoning damage and the target is restrained). The mouth stays shut for one minute before opening. A restrained character can free their hand with a DC 15 Strength check.
- **Tiny Runes**: A character making a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check while searching the demon carving notices tiny runes engraved into the demon's tongue. A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the runes deal with fire and flame. See "Demon Breath Trap" for more details.

**Wooden Door**: An average lock (DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools opens) protects this stout (AC 15, hp 20, immune to poison and psychic damage) door. Valentin held the only key, but it is now long lost.

#### **P ORTCULLIS TRAP**

**Trigger**: A creature standing on the hidden pressure plate in front of the Demonic Door triggers the portcullis trap.

**Spotting the Trap**: A character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the pressure plate in front of the door or the disguised bottom of the portcullis (depending on where they search).

**Disabling the Trap**: A DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools disables the pressure plate. A check result of DC 10 or lower sets off the trap. Alternatively, the characters can lift the portcullis (DC 25 Strength check succeeds) or destroy it (AC 19, hp 50, damage threshold 8, immune to fire, poison and psychic damage).

**Effect**: The iron portcullis hidden in the ceiling at the bottom of the stairs drops down. Characters under the portcullis suffer 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and are restrained (DC 15 Strength check ends). A DC 15 Dexterity saving throw halves this damage and negates the restrained effect; characters making the saving throw can choose to jump forward or backward out of the portcullis's way.

#### **DEMON BREATH TRAP**

**Trigger**: A creature opening the Demonic Door triggers the trap. See "Demon's Breath" and "The Guardian Appears" below.

**Spotting the Trap**: A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the faint glimmer of flame at the back of the demon's mouth. See also "Tiny Runes" under "Demon Face Carving".

**Disabling the Trap**: A character making a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check removes the magic lurking in the demon's mouth by effacing some of the runes carved onto its tongue. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 13 ability check using the character's spellcasting ability) cast on the demon face carving destroys the trap. Smashing the carving also destroys the trap.

**Demon's Breath**: Flames burst from the demon's mouth, filling the 15-foot of corridor in front of the door. Creatures in the corridor suffer 11 (2d10) fire damage (DC 15 Dexterity save halves). The trap resets after one minute.

<span id="page-104-0"></span>**The Guardian Appears**: One round after the Demon's Breath effect, the faint flicker of flame appears in the carven demon's mouth. The next round, a **fire elemental lesser guardian**  forms in the mouth and issues forth to slay intruders.

#### D16: TREASURE VAULT O F THE IRONWOLVES

Here, Valentin stored his (sadly depleted) wealth. This area was not looted during the keep's fall and has lain undisturbed since then.

**Denizen**: Valentin was more than a little paranoid, and thus he expended a good portion of his loot commissioning a deathless, incorruptible guard—a **necrophidius**. The necrophidius attacks anyone who does not display the Ironwolf sigil.

*This dusty chamber has a low ceiling, and several chest-filled niches pierce the walls. A sinuous snake skeleton topped with a fanged human skull rises gracefully from the floor at your arrival.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is eight feet high.

**Stone Niches**: Stone niches pierce the chamber's walls. Each is about a five-foot square and holds an (unlocked) chest.

**Treasure**: The Ironwolves' remaining treasures fill several of the chests in this room. The treasure comprises:

- **Mixed Coinage**: 1,287 cp, 427 sp and 78 gp in five small sacks.
- **Fine Longsword**: This finely balanced weapon has the Ironwolf crest carved into its oval-shaped pommel and rests in a plain, dusty leather scabbard.
- **Shield**: This iron shield has a raised black boss wrought in the shape of a snarling wolf's head—the Ironwolf family crest.
- *Potion of Greater Healing*: This small iron vial holds a red liquid. Shaking the vial makes the red liquid glimmer.
- *Driftglobe*: A soft black velvet pouch holds a small sphere of thick glass. Red thread stitching on the bag spells out the word, "Sitheran". This is the *driftglobe's* command word.
- **Gems**: A soft black velvet pouch holds two small opaque orange stones (carnelians worth 50 gp each) and one lustrous white stone (a pearl worth 100 gp).

![](_page_104_Picture_15.jpeg)

# <span id="page-105-0"></span>REALM O F THE BLOOD MOON

The Blood Moon tribe, led by their dread chieftain **Ruknar**, claims the cellars below Ironwolf Keep. Several in the tribe resent Ruknar and secretly plot to overthrow him. Until now, his martial prowess and boundless appetite for barbaric cruelty dissuade all from striking against him. The characters' arrival, however, may be just the opportunity the shaman **Sar** needs to finally strike.

#### ARCHITECTURE & ENVIRONMENT

The dungeon has the following general features:

**Illumination**: Darkness.

**Ceilings**: The ceilings are 8 ft. high.

**Flagstone Floor**: The floor's flagstones have started to shift and move under time's remorseless influence, but generally, they do not inhibit movement.

**Stone Walls**: The walls are of dressed stone (DC 20 Strength [Athletics] check scales) in fair condition. In places, moss and lichens grow on the walls, and water oozes through the mortar.

**Wooden Door**: Doors (AC 15, hp 20, immune to poison and psychic damage) open into the room or space beyond. A locked door can be opened with a DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone using thieves' tools.

# RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

The characters have a 1 in 10 chance of encountering some of the dungeon's denizens for every 10 minutes, they remain below ground. Each encounter can occur only once. If the creatures are defeated, remove them from the relevant encounter area.

| D20   | LOCATION | ENCOUNTER                                         |
|-------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1-5   | M7       | Blood Moon warriors (3)                           |
| 6-12  | M1       | Blood Moon sniper (1), Blood Moon<br>warriors (2) |
| 13-18 | M7       | Blood Moon noncombatant (4)                       |
| 19    | M8       | Fuzght & Mugut (orc mercenaries)                  |
| 20    | M12      | Razogen, Blood Moon warriors (3)                  |

#### ECOLOGY & SOCIETY

The tribe has many small lairs and outposts scattered throughout the forest. This small band dwells below Ironwolf Keep. They jealously guard their subterranean home and skirmish with the bandits claiming the watchtower. Vicious combatants, the concept of a fair fight is totally lost on the Blood Moon goblins.

The vast majority of the tribe are typical unimaginative and sadistic goblins. A few are of note, however:

- **Razogen (M12)**: Ruknar's young son, Razogen, desperately craves his father's approval and is fanatically loyal to him.
- **Ruknar (M13)**: The tribe's chieftain, this powerful ogre, is a bully and sadist of breath-taking enthusiasm.

• **Sar (M11)**: The tribe's shaman, Sar, incessantly plots against Ruknar and tries to enlist the characters to his cause.

All the stat blocks for the cellar's denizens appear in Appendix 4: Blood Moon Denizens.

# A COORDINATED DEFENCE

Because they skirmish with the bandits of the watchtower, the goblins have a basic plan to combat serious incursions into their lair. When it becomes clear the tribe faces a serious threat, Ruknar emerges from his chambers to lead the defence. Accompanied by his concubines and son, he gathers any nearby warriors and charges to the sound of battle.

If Ruknar falls, the remaining goblins flee the ruins as quickly as possible, taking with them anything of value they can quickly collect. If Razogen survives his father's death, he also flees but swears revenge against his father's killers.

#### CELLAR KE Y

- **M1 Guardroom:** Four **Blood Moon warriors** and two **Blood Moon snipers** occupy this guardroom. All are likely distracted when the characters first assault the cellar.
- **M2 Well Chamber**: This chamber features a well that secretly links to the well in the watchtower's cellar (location W2).
- **M3 Emissaries of the Grinning Skull**: Two visiting **Grinning Skull bugbears** lair here.
- **M4 Storeroom**: The tribe uses this chamber to store their foodstuffs. While they prefer the taste of fresh meat, when their supply of prisoners runs low, they use the food stored here.
- **M5 Armoury**: The Blood Moon store their weapons and armour here. They also store captured mundane equipment here.
- **M6 Cavern-Pit of the Devourer**: A trapped **gelatinous cube** lurks in this natural cavern.
- **M7 Common Room Complex**: This network of chambers—once a series of small cells and associated chambers—serves as the tribe's common room and private living area.
- **M8 Orc Mercenaries**: Two **orc mercenaries**, Fuzght and Mugut, dwell here. They serve as the tribe's shock troops and venture forth on important raids or to repulse dangerous intruders.
- **M9 Guardroom**: Three **Blood Moon warriors** and one **Blood Moon bruiser** guard this room (which also doubles as a torture chamber).
- **M10 Prisoners of the Blood Moon**: The tribe uses this unfinished part of the keep's cellars as a prison.
- **M11 Shaman of the Blood Moon**: These chambers serve as the Blood Moon's fane.
- **M11a Sar's Personal Chamber**: Here dwells **Sar**—Blood Moon shaman, and want-to-be chief.
- **M12 Guardians of the Blood Moon**: **Razogen** has been honoured with the task of defending the approach to his father's inner sanctum. He watches here with three **Blood Moon bruisers**.
- **M13 Chieftain of the Blood Moon**: **Ruknar** dwells here with his large and aggressive trio of **Blood Moon concubines**.

# M1: GUARDROOM

**Denizens**: Four **Blood Moon warriors** and two **Blood Moon snipers** occupy this guardroom. However, the goblins' vigil has become somewhat lax of late. When the characters first reach this area, the guards argue over a game of chance and are distracted. Intruders automatically hear the argument while on the stairs unless they are distracted. The first time they come here, the characters surprise the guards unless they make an exceptional amount of noise on the stairs or set off the trap in area D4.

*A faint glimmer of light emanates from a small fire smouldering between four slender pillars. Tables and chairs—occupied by a halfdozen filthy humanoids—stand nearby.* 

An injured goblin retreats to warn the tribe of the attack. Once one goblin has fled, the others retreat down the western corridor.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: Darkness fills much of the chamber; dim light surrounds the smouldering fire in a 10 ft. radius.

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is 10 ft. high; black soot coats the ceiling above the fire.

**Fire**: A small fire smoulders amid a pile of rubble. Several rats wrapped in leaves slowly cook in the embers.

**Downward Stairs**: The air in this stairway is cold. The stairs lead to location U1.

**Walls**: The walls of this chamber are of dressed stone. Here and there, water oozes down the wall, and mould grows. On the drier patches of wall, goblins have scrapped and drawn lurid graffiti. Many of the scenes depict slaughter and torture.

**Slender Pillars**: Four slender pillars hold the roof aloft. A character in an adjacent square gains half cover. An empty iron torch sconce hangs from each pillar.

**Tables and Benches**: Two long tables and six chairs stand near the fire.

#### M2: WELL CHAMBER

This small chamber's main feature is a well that takes its water directly from the same stream that flows under the bandit's watchtower (see W2). Characters discovering the connection between the two can use this route to assault the goblins' liar.

*A crumbling low wall surrounds what looks to be a well. Two buckets—each attached to a short length of rope—lie nearby.* 

This area is not normally garrisoned. If goblins from location M1 have been forced to retreat here, they use the well's low, crumbling stone wall for cover.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Well**: A crumbling 2 ft. high stone wall encircles this 20 ft. deep well. If a character sits or leans on the wall, it collapses, and the character falls into the well and suffers 2d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 10 Dexterity saving throw negates). The well's rough-hewn walls (DC 15 Strength [Athletics] check scales) descend to a shallow stream. To the southeast lies the well in the dungeons below the watchtower (location W2.) The goblins (and the bandits) are unaware of this connection. See "Further Adventures", for more details on what lies to the northwest.

**Torch Sconces**: Three empty iron torch sconces hang from the chamber's walls.

#### M3: EMISSARIES O F THE GRINNING SKULL

**Denizens**: Ruknar has billeted a visiting pair of **Grinning Skull bugbears** here. The pair make no move to aid the goblins in defending their lair but fight viciously if attacked. If attacked, the bugbears seek to escape at the first opportunity. If the characters initially bypass this area, the emissaries leave to inform their tribe of the attack (and the goblins' likely doom).

*Two piles of sleeping furs lie against one wall; camping gear is strewn nearby.* 

<span id="page-108-0"></span>The Grinning Skull's chieftain has recently proposed an "alliance" between the two groups, which Ruknar is considering. Of course, this is the first stage in the chieftain's plan to conquer the Blood Moon goblins and turn them into little more than slaves and expendable warriors. While the emissaries await Ruknar's response, they linger here.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Camping Gear**: The emissaries' gear—two small piles of furs, the remains of several meals and other odds and ends—lie scattered about the chamber. None of it has appreciable worth.

#### M4: STOREROOM

The tribe uses this chamber to store their foodstuffs. While they prefer the taste of fresh meat, when their supply of prisoners runs low, they use the food stored here.

**Door**: The room's wooden door is swollen (DC 10 Strength check opens) but not locked.

*An untidy tangle of boxes and barrels fills much of this chamber.* 

Goblins are not normally encountered here. If the characters decide to rest in the complex, this area makes an excellent camp as the many boxes and barrels can be used to block the door.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Boxes**: The many boxes here hold looted foodstuffs captured by the tribe during their raids. They contain salted meats, flour, grain and so on and can be looted as rations.

**Barrels**: Three large barrels hold sour, vinegary red wine. One is half-empty.

# M5: ARMOURY

The Blood Moon store their weapons and armour here. They also store captured mundane equipment here.

**Door**: The room's wooden door is swollen (DC 10 Strength check opens) but not locked.

*This small room serves as an armoury. Small-sized suits of leather armour lie heaped in one corner near a pile of haphazardly dumped small shields. Sagging shelves holding a jumbled array of weapons line the walls.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Sagging Shelves**: The shelves sag dangerously. A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the shelves could not take a human's weight. However, a light climber could easily scale the shelves without them collapsing.

• **Hidden Treasure**: A small dust-covered pouch lies on the top shelf, hidden behind a rotting rag. A character climbing the shelves who makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the pouch. It contains 13 gp and a small tarnished gold ring (worth 25 gp).

**Armour and Shields**: Eleven suits of leather armour sized for goblins—all emblazoned with the tribe's sigil—lie in a pile. Several have gashes in them (in all likelihood, evidence of fatal wounds). A like number of shields—all also emblazoned with the tribe's sigil lie next to the pile.

**Weapons**: Roughly a dozen daggers, morningstars, short swords and shortbows (along with around 200 arrows) lie in glorious disorganisation on the shelves; all are sized for goblins.

**Captured Equipment**: The goblins store captured equipment on the shelves. This includes four morningstars, two longswords, five suits of studded leather armour and two suits of scale mail along with backpacks, belts, pouches and so on. All these items are sized for Medium-sized creatures.

![](_page_108_Picture_21.jpeg)

#### <span id="page-109-0"></span>HIDDEN BOLTHOLE

The goblins have not discovered this room's hidden bolthole.

**Secret Door**: A character making a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a secret door behind the pile of leather armour. A loose stone at the wall's base hides its opening mechanism (an easily depressed catch). The door is only 2 ft. high and leads to a long-forgotten hidden bolthole.

This place was designed as a refugee for use in times of peril. During the keep's fall, none of the defenders made it here.

*Cobwebs throng the ceiling of this small, roughly finished chamber. Trackless dust lies thickly on the floor. A small chest stands against one wall next to a pile of mouldering bedrolls. The flickering light of a torch fills the room.* 

#### The niche contains:

- One torch with a *continual flame* cast upon it.
- Four musty bedrolls.
- An empty barrel that one held water.
- An unlocked chest containing rotten and decayed food, oncefine travellers' clothes and the like.

# M6: CAVERN-PI T O F THE DEVOURER

**Denizen**: A trapped **gelatinous cube** lurks in this cavern.

The goblins utilise this sinkhole to dispose of rubbish. Occasionally, Ruknar drags a prisoner or ill-favoured goblin here. The unfortunate is hurled into the cavern below, whereupon the trapped gelatinous cube consumes them. Such events are much anticipated by the tribe, and many come to watch the spectacle.

*This natural cavern is roughly 30-foot wide, 40-foot long and 30 foot deep. Several small passageways—high up in the cavern walls —lead away from the cavern.* 

The gelatinous cube mindlessly patrols the cavern searching for food; it has not realised food often appears from above and thus does not lurk directly beneath the sinkhole. A character making a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the cavern floor is completely (and suspiciously) clear of debris.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Depth**: The sinkhole is 30 ft. deep. Characters falling into the sinkhole take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and land prone.

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is of natural stone (DC 25 Strength [Athletics] check scales).

**Walls**: The cavern and sinkhole walls are of natural stone (DC 15 Strength [Athletics] check scales). Several small passageways lead away from this cavern; they are high up on the walls, and the

![](_page_109_Picture_19.jpeg)

<span id="page-110-0"></span>gelatinous cube cannot reach them. See "To Deeper Caverns" below for more details.

**Floor**: The pit's floor is of stone; no mud, sand or other detritus mars its surface. For perceptive characters, the floor provides an important clue as to what lurks within this chamber.

#### TO DEEPER CAVERNS…

The passages leading away from the cavern-pit lead to an extensive network of caverns deep below the Shadowed Keep. See "Further Adventures", for more details.

#### M7: COMMON ROOM COMPLEX

This network of chambers—once a series of small cells and associated chambers—serves as the tribe's common room and private living area.

**Denizens**: Normally, eight **Blood Moon warriors,** two **Blood Moon snipers** and one **Blood Moon bruiser,** along with about a score of females and young (**Blood Moon noncombatants**) congregate in this area. The state of this area depends on whether the characters take the occupants by surprise.

- **Denizens (Surprised)**: If the characters surprise the goblins, the females and young are here cooking, talking, arguing and so on. Characters with a passive Perception score of 10 or more hear the general commotion of the goblins going about their daily lives as they approach. Three **Blood Moon warriors** are also here. When the characters arrive, the noncombatants scatter while the warriors move to defend their home. The other eight goblin combatants arrive on the second round of combat.
- **Denizens (Unsurprised)**: If the characters are expected, no non-combatants linger in the communal eating area; rather, they have all taken shelter in their personal chambers. Instead, all 11 of the room's defenders hide among the tables and unleash a barrage of missiles at the most capable-looking enemy warriors.

*Two large tables and many chairs stand around this chamber. A huge fireplace—complete with a blazing fire and gigantic spit upon which some kind of meat cooks—dominates one wall.* 

The warriors fight hard to protect the tribe's females and young. They prefer to snipe from the corridors or from behind tables, hoping to keep the intruders away from the living areas. Unless

cornered and given no chance to surrender, the young and females do not fight.

![](_page_110_Picture_12.jpeg)

This large area was once a guardroom

f o r t h e a t t e n d a n t cells; now, the g o b l i n s e a t and relax here.

**Illumination**: Normal light fills the room within 30 ft. of the fireplace. Dim light extends for another 30 ft.

**Tables and Chairs**: There are two sturdy wooden tables in this room. Each is 3 ft. high and covered in the foul detritus of the goblins' feasting. Scraps of food and wine stains cover the floor around the tables and benches.

Characters behind or under a table have half cover.

**Fireplace**: A huge fireplace, its stones blackened with soot, pierces one wall. The fireplace features a fiercely burning fire and a huge spit upon which the decapitated corpse of a human cooks.

The fireplace is 15 ft. wide and utilises a natural fissure in the rock that rises directly upwards for 10 ft. before turning west. A character can climb the chimney with DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks. After another 30 ft., the fissure opens into a small, lowceiling cave; soot covers its walls, floor and ceiling.

#### LIVING QUARTERS

The cells have several noteworthy features:

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is 6 ft. high.

**Doors**: Each small cell has a rusting iron-bound door (AC 17, hp 22, immune to poison and psychic damage). While each has a simple lock (DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone proficient with thieves' tools unlocks), the keys were lost long ago.

**Cells**: Occupied cells serve as a goblin family's home. Mangy blankets, mouldering bracken and rotting grass cover the floor. Mingled with this are the family's pathetic, valueless possessions.

If a character searches a cell and makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, they find something of value. Roll once for each cell searched. Each "treasure" can be found only once; re-roll duplicate treasures.

# <span id="page-111-0"></span>M8: OR C MERCENARIES

**Denizens**: Two **orc mercenaries,** Fuzght and Mugut, dwell here. They serve as the Blood Moon's shock troops, only venturing forth on important raids or to repulse dangerous intruders.

The orcs rest here unless aiding their goblin paymasters. If battle has raged throughout the complex, they are ready for action and lurk, ready to surprise anyone passing or entering their room. If not, they sit at the table drinking cheap, sour wine and arguing about who is better at decapitating enemies. The characters' arrival gives them the perfect opportunity to decide the argument.

*This decent-sized chamber features two large beds, a sturdy chest table and two chairs.* 

Aggressive fighters, the orc's instinct is to take the fight to intruders. Trusting to their prodigious strength and vitality, they strike suddenly, preferably from ambush. If surprised in their quarters, they force their way from the room, using a bench to shove foes into the corridor. They delight in slaughtering their enemies and, if not pressed closely, stop to (gleefully) decapitate fallen foes.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Beds**: Two large, sturdy beds stand against one wall.

**Table**: This sturdy wooden table is 3 ft. high. Characters under or behind it have half cover. Characters under the table automatically spot a key (DC 20 Wisdom [Perception] check otherwise discovers) nailed to the table's underside. The key opens the orcs' chest.

**Locked Chest**: The orcs store their pay, loot and personal possessions in this chest (AC 15, hp 10, immune to poison and psychic damage, DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone using thieves' tools unlocks). Along with their rancid mundane personal possessions, the chest holds 367 cp, 197 sp and 87 gp.

#### M9 GUARDROOM

**Denizens**: Three **Blood Moon warriors** and one **Blood Moon bruiser** guard this room (which also doubles as a torture chamber). Although they are tasked with watching the orc mercenaries (location M8) and the tribe's prisoners (location M10) they are complacent. Thus, unless warned of intruders, the guards have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

**Door**: The door to this chamber is partially open when the characters first reach this area.

*A table and two benches stand in the rough centre of the chamber. A barred, stout door pierces the far wall. Another table holds objects of obvious torture. A rust-coloured stain covers a nearby bench and the surrounding floor.* 

Unless alerted, the guards sit at the table, swapping lies about their raids and kills. If they are aware of approaching intruders, the goblins push over their table (for half cover). When enemies appear, the goblins shoot their bows until forced to melee. When one of the goblins is slain, the survivors retreat to location M10. Once inside, one holds the door using the Dodge action while the other vindictively slaughters the prisoners (starting with the humans).

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: It is dark in the chamber, except within 10 ft. of the smouldering brazier; the burning coals therein emit dim light.

**Smell**: A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check detects the slight stench of burnt flesh in the air (along with the smell of goblin sweat and cheap wine).

**Barred Wooden Door**: A sturdy, barred (but not locked) stout wooden door leads to the tribe's prison (location M10). A large nail driven into the door holds a bunch of keys. There are the keys for the manacles used in the prison beyond the door.

**Smouldering Brazier**: Several irons poke from the smouldering coal-filled wrought iron brazier. Characters can draw a poker from the fire and use it as an improvised weapon that inflicts 1d6 piercing damage and 1 fire damage. A character holding a poker at the end of their turns suffers 1 fire damage.

**Torture Equipment**: A bench against one wall holds several objects of torture—clamps, pokers, pliers and so on.

**Bloodstained Bench**: The goblins strap prisoners prone to this bench before torturing them. Dried blood covers the bench and surrounding flagstones.

#### M10: PRISONERS O F THE BLOOD MOON

The tribe uses this unfinished part of the keep's cellars as a prison.

**Denizens**: Currently, two brigands (**Jorma Lempiä** and **Unto Tapio**), a mercenary warrior (**Kerkko Salme**) and five disarmed **Blood Moon warriors** languish here.

*This long chamber's natural walls glisten with moisture. The ceiling is low—barely 5 ft. high. Within, slumped against the walls, languish three humans and five goblins. All are chained to the walls and look like they have been recently beaten. At the sight of you, the humans call for aid while the goblins hiss and draw back.* 

All the goblins' prisoners greatly desire their freedom. Stat blocks and full details for the human prisoners appear in Appendix 4.

- **Goblins (5)**: These Blood Moon warriors have all displeased Ruknar in some way and are doomed to either be eaten by their fellows or fed to the Devourer (location M6). They are desperate to escape and agree to anything—even fighting their comrades. Of course, they are lying and, if armed, turn on their rescuers as soon as they meet more of their tribe.
- **Jorma Lempiä**: One of the brigands from the watchtower, Jorma (CN male human; Appendix 4), thirsts for revenge on the goblins.
- **Kerkko Salme**: A mercenary guard—the only survivor of his small caravan—Kerkko (LN male human; Appendix 4) has been here for two weeks.
- **Unto Tapio**: Jorma's friend and fellow bandit, Unto (CN male human; Appendix 4), is a coward and desperate to escape.

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is 5 ft. high.

**Walls**: This area was unfinished when the keep fell. Thus, the walls are of hewn rock.

<span id="page-112-0"></span>**Manacles**: Each prisoner is bound to the wall with manacles (DC 20 Dexterity check escapes, DC 20 Strength check breaks, DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools unlocks). Each is secured to the wall by a normal lock (DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools unlocks).

#### M11: SHAMAN O F THE BLOOD MOON

These chambers serve as the Blood Moon's fane and their shaman's home.

**Stout Wooden Door**: A sturdy, stout wooden door (AC 15, hp 20, immune to poison and psychic damage) protects this area. If Sar has been warned of intruders abroad in the complex, the door is barred from within (DC 20 Strength check opens).

**Denizens**: The Blood Moon's shaman, **Sar**, is as loyal a member of the tribe as any goblin—that is, he lusts for power and advancement but is terrified of Ruknar's power. The characters' arrival gives Sar an idea; he immediately starts plotting to use them to kill Ruknar so he may become chieftain.

Two **Blood Moon bruisers** guard Sar. When the characters arrive, they are hiding behind slender pillars watching the entrance. If they spot intruders, they shout for Sar and ready themselves for combat. Once Sar becomes aware of intruders, he calls for parley (see "Sar" for details).

*Several slender pillars hold aloft this large chamber's vaulted ceiling. At the chamber's far end, a large recess holds an altar covered in candles. Strange, obviously evil symbols cover the walls.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: The candles on the altar bathe it in normal light and provide dim light in a 5-foot radius. Darkness fills the balance of the chamber.

**Ceiling**: The ceiling arches to 15 ft. in height.

**Slender Pillars**: Four slender pillars hold the ceiling aloft. An empty iron torch sconce hangs from each pillar.

**Altar**: The altar is actually a heavy table covered in an old, rancid sheet drenched with bloodstains, melted candle wax and other unidentifiable substances.

**Symbols**: Symbols of obviously evil, malign intent cover the walls. Sar daubed these in blood but, in truth, doesn't really understand them. A DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check reveals that although they appear sinister, they are essentially gibberish.

**Skulls**: The skulls of four Medium-sized humanoids flank the altar. A DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that their skin and other soft tissues were removed by boiling.

#### M11A: SA R' S PERSONAL CHAMBER

Here dwells **Sar**.

*Bric-a-brac fills this small chamber. A bed of furs lies in one corner, and a workbench covered with magical paraphernalia and a chest stand against another wall.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Fur Bed**: A pile of rank fur comprises Sar's bed. The furs are fleabitten, dirty and smell.

**Workbench**: Covered with objects of supposed magical power, the bench is a triumph of disorganisation. A character spending ten minutes sorting through it finds enough material to make one healer's kit and one component pouch.

**Chest**: The locked chest (AC 15, hp 10, immune to poison and psychic damage; DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone using thieves' tools unlocks) contains four sticks of incense (each worth 5 gp), a golden statue of a dretch (DC 15 Intelligence [Arcana] identifies; worth 50 gp) and 136 sp. Sar carries the key to this chest secreted in his robes.

![](_page_112_Picture_21.jpeg)

#### <span id="page-113-0"></span>M12: GUARDIANS O F THE BLOOD MOON

**Denizens**: **Razogen** and three **Blood Moon bruisers** have been honoured with the task of defending the approach to his father's inner sanctum. He is very keen to add to his skull display and attacks intruders immediately.

The guards here chase fleeing intruders. Unless the characters immediately surrender, they cannot avoid fighting Razogen. Razogen is a ferocious warrior, desperate to gain his father's approval. He hurls himself into battle, seeking out the biggest opponent to slay.

**Door**: This chamber's wooden door is swollen and partially open so the occupants can watch the corridor.

*This smallish room contains a blazing fire set into the floor, a table and several benches. A primitive display of skulls atop a tripod stands near the door.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: The fire fills the room with normal light.

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is 10 ft. high.

**Fire**: A large fire burns inside a ring of stones. The fire's smoke escapes through many cracks in the ceiling.

Characters can leap the blazing fire with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check; a character failing this check lands in the flames suffers 1d4 fire damage, and must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or catch on fire. A character on fire suffers 1d4 fire damage at the start of its turn but can make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames by using their action.

**Table**: This sturdy wooden table is 2 ft. high. Characters under the table have half cover.

**Decorative Skulls**: Razogen has started to collect the skulls of those he has slain to celebrate his savage prowess.

#### M13: CHIEFTAIN O F THE BLOOD MOON

Here dwells the Blood Moon's savage ogre chieftain.

**Denizens**: **Ruknar** dwells here with his large and aggressive concubine-consorts Nig, Sbux and Zus (**Blood Moon concubines**). Each concubine vies for the honour of bearing his young and attacks intruders savagely to gain his favour. If Ruknar and his concubines are unaware of intruders, they are lounging about the table when the characters arrive. If alerted to impending danger, they are ready for battle.

*A long, very low table stands behind a blazing fire. Piles of furs surround the table, which is heaped with food and drink. The fire's* 

![](_page_113_Picture_16.jpeg)

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Illumination**: A blazing fire fills the room with normal light.

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is 20 ft. high.

**Torch Sconces**: Four empty torch sconces hang from the chamber's walls.

**Fire**: A large fire burns inside a ring of stones. The fire's smoke escapes through many cracks in the ceiling.

Characters can leap the blazing fire with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check; a character failing this check lands in the flames suffers 1d4 fire damage and must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or catch on fire. A character on fire suffers 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its subsequent turns, but can make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames by using their action.

Ruknar hides a large key in a secret hollow beneath the fire (DC 25 Wisdom [Perception] check locates if the fire is lit, DC 15 Wisdom [Perception] check locates if the fire is extinguished). The key opens Ruknar's large ironbound chest.

**Trophy Wall**: Broken weapons, skulls, sundered armour and other items of battle booty are nailed to one wall. All are worthless but serve as testimony to Ruknar's battle prowess.

**Tapestries**: Faded and stained tapestries cover the chamber's walls. Depicting scenes of battle and death, they have been looted from the ruins above. All are worthless.

Characters behind the tapestries are heavily obscured. The tapestries are only loosely affixed to the wall and can be pulled free with a DC 10 Strength check, perhaps onto an enemy. A

character trying to entangle a foe in a tapestry must first pull it from the wall. The tapestry then attempts a grapple by making a Strength (Athletics) check (+8 modifier). Success indicates the target is grappled until they break free from the tapestry.

**Low Table**: This sturdy wooden table is 1 ft. high; its legs have been deliberately shortened. Mounds of fur—used as seats surround the table.

**Large Ironbound Chest**: This large ironbound chest (AC 17, hp 15, immune to poison and psychic damage; DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone using thieves' tools unlocks) holds the tribe's accumulated wealth.

- **Mixed Coinage**: 795 cp, 497 sp, 296 gp and 19 pp.
- **Jewellery**: A golden necklace set with four small translucent yellow gems (carnelians) worth 150 gp.
- **Thieves' Tools**: These finely made thieves' tools nestle in a soft black leather pouch (which bears the initials A.H.)
- *Wand of Secrets*: Runes of power are carved into this long, tapered wand of dark purple, almost black willow. The wand is crafted from an aged piece of rosewood, and the runes carved into its surface deal with secrets and magic.
- **Treasure Map**: This faded map shows the location of the lost dwarven hold of Vongyth (see Player Handout 2).

# <span id="page-115-0"></span>TH E UNDERCRYPT

This small dungeon sub-level lies below the cellars and is free of the Blood Moon goblins. Built by Valentin to house the remains of those who fell in his service, the Undercrypt has laid mostly undisturbed since the keep's fall. However, an earthquake two decades ago linked the Undercrypt to deeper caverns, and an insidious, ancient corruption has begun to seep forth.

#### A NOTE ON RELIGION

The chapel and Undercrypt are dedicated to the hero-god Kalron, hero-god of battle and heroic struggle. It is a simple job to exchange this personage for one more suitable to your campaign. If you decide to do so, remember to change the descriptions of the various statues, religious symbols and so on throughout this area and surrounding chambers to better suit your chosen deity.

#### KALRON

N hero-god of battle, martial skill and heroic struggle

**Epithets**: The Warrior

**Symbol**: A two-headed battleaxe

**Domains**: War

**Favoured Weapon**: Battleaxe

**Raiment**: Followers of Kalron normally wear armour of some sort, over which they wear a tabard with the god's axe sigil emblazoned upon it.

**Worshippers**: Guards, soldiers, mercenaries and warriors

**Teachings**: Through hardship and struggle comes strength and glory. Sacrifice begets strength. Become one with your weapon, for in such unity lies unbreakable strength.

**Holy Texts**: Kalron's followers study the *Art of the Fighting-Master*. This book sets out the techniques required to wield an array of weapons, including the battleaxe, longsword and morningstar. Additionally, it comprises many lessons on determination, struggle, courage and strength through adversity. Various worshippers have written additional treatises—for example, Lempinen's *On the Axe*—which deals with more advanced fighting techniques and practises.

**Additional Notes**: Kalron was an ancient hero elevated to divine status because of his legendary bravery, battlefield exploits and devotion to his martial skills. His worship is comparatively new, given Kalron ascended to godhood mere centuries ago.

**Temples & Shrines**: Most shrines to the hero-god are found in barracks, castles and other places worshippers gather.

#### ARCHITECTURE & ENVIRONMENT

The Undercrypt has the following generic features:

**Illumination**: Darkness.

**Ceiling**: In most areas, the ceiling is between 10 – 15 ft. high.

**Temperature**: It is noticeably colder in the Undercrypt than in the other caverns and cellars below the keep. In most areas, the lower temperature has no mechanical effects. (However, this is not the case in area U6.)

**Dripping Water**: Cold water drips into the Undercrypt from above. The constant sound of dripping water give disadvantage to hearing-based Wisdom (Perception) checks.

Additionally, unless the characters rig some kind of protection from the unceasing dripping, it is impossible to get a good night's rest in the Undercrypt.

**Grey Sludge**: The water dripping from the ceiling has turned the Undercrypt's deep dust into a grey sludge. A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals the sludge to be harmless.

The sludge makes tracking much easier. Characters making checks to find or follow tracks do so with advantage. Where the sludge is particularly deep, it counts as difficult terrain.

**Hewn Stone Walls**: The slick walls are of hewn stone. Crudely hacked from the hill's bedrock, they provide numerous hand and footholds for climbers (DC 15 Strength [Athletics] check scales).

**Necrotic Corruption**: Necrotic corruption has leaked into the Undercrypt from below, corrupting the bodies of those interred within. A character casting *detect evil and good* discovers the Undercrypt was once magically consecrated but that a subsequent more powerful desecration effect now lies over the place. (The source of this corruption is a matter for you to decide, but see "U6: Chasm of Ebon Depths" for more information.)

# UNDERCRYPT DRESSING

Use this table to generate minor points of interest, as desired. Such features have little or no impact on play, but serve to underscore the current state of the Undercrypt.

#### **D12 DRESSING**

| 1  | Thick grey sludge covers the floor. Treat the area as<br>difficult terrain.                                                                         |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2  | Pocket of frigid air dot the area.                                                                                                                  |
| 3  | A faint breeze issues from the direction of the stairs<br>leading up to the cellars.                                                                |
| 4  | A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the faint<br>sound of rainfall (this is the sound of water falling into<br>the Ebon Chasm [U6]).          |
| 5  | Deep cracks run through the walls and ceiling.                                                                                                      |
| 6  | The sludge hides a small hole in the floor. A random<br>character stumbles and falls prone in the sludge (DC<br>15 Dexterity saving throw negates). |
| 7  | The crumpled bones of some long-ago explorer<br>sprawl on the floor. No salvageable equipment<br>remains to be looted.                              |
| 8  | The faint stench of decay hangs in the air.                                                                                                         |
| 9  | Thick grey sludge covers the floors, and hides several<br>holes. Unwary characters could trip and fall.                                             |
| 10 | "For the Warrior's Glory" is etched into a wall.                                                                                                    |
| 11 | A rusty torch sconce hangs drunkenly from the wall.                                                                                                 |
| 12 | A glob of sludge falls from the ceiling onto the lead<br>character's head.                                                                          |

# <span id="page-116-0"></span>UNDERCRYPT KE Y

- **U1 Pit of the Dead**: This 20-foot deep pit holds two sodden **zombies** and bars access to the rest of the sub-level. Beyond, a sodden door wards the rest of the Undercrypt.
- **U2 Hall of Battle**: Intricate carvings of Valentin Ironwolf's victories decorate this uninhabited corridor.
- **U3 Warrior's Chapel**: This large chamber was the keep's chapel. It is unoccupied.
- **U4 Columned Hallway**: Two **animate statues** protect this earthquake-damaged corridor. If too many of the pillars are damaged here, the ceiling collapses.
- **U5 The Crypt**: Four **gravechill skeletons**, along with animate skulls attached to chains hanging from the ceiling, lurk in this chill chamber.
- **U6 Chasm of Ebon Depths**: Necrotic corruption wells up into the Undercrypt from this deep chasm. **Shadows** dwell within.

![](_page_116_Picture_7.jpeg)

![](_page_116_Figure_8.jpeg)

# <span id="page-117-0"></span>U1: PI T O F THE DEAD

The characters must cross this area to access the Undercrypt.

**Denizens**: Two sodden human **zombies** lie under the pit's black water. The remains of two bandits who triggered this trap long ago attack any living creatures in the pit. The zombies are so water-logged they have fire resistance while in the pit and for one hour after they emerge. The zombies fight until destroyed or until there are no living creatures in sight. If there are no living creatures in the pit, they climb out to kill any other visible targets.

*A narrow, dust-shrouded stair descends about thirty feet and ends in a corridor. The walls and floor are wet and glisten in your light. The sound of dripping water fills your ears.* 

When the characters reach the bottom of the stairs, read:

*This narrow corridor ends in a wall pierced by a single doorway, partially filled by a rotting wooden door. An open 20 ft. long pit blocks further progress. Black water fills the pit.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Steep Stairs**: Characters taking the Dash action on the stairs must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A character failing this check falls 1d2x5 ft. and lands prone.

**Ceiling**: The ceiling above the stairs is only six feet high. In the corridor, it rises to 12 ft.

**Walls**: The slick, hewn stone walls require DC 20 Strength (Athletics) checks to scale. Water oozes down the walls.

**Rotten Door**: This rotten door blocks the view of what lies beyond but collapses as soon as a character touches it.

#### TH E PI T

The pit blocks progress along the passageway and has the following noteworthy features:

**Depth**: The pit is 20 ft. deep. Characters falling into the shallow pit suffer 2d6 bludgeoning damage and land prone.

**Walls**: Characters can scale the pit's slick walls with DC 20 Strength (Athletics) checks.

**Water**: Three-foot-deep black, stagnant water fills the pit. Characters in the water have half cover.

# U2: HALL O F BAT TLE

This hallway is unoccupied.

*An intricate bas-relief carving of human warriors fighting a host of orcs and goblins covers one long wall of this hallway.* 

Valentin had this hallway decorated in celebration of his great victory against his orc and goblin enemies.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Battle Carving**: This intricate bas-relief carving depicts a woodland battle between Valentin's followers and his enemies: the Severed Hand orcs and the Blood Moon goblins. The humans are shown crushing their enemies and trampling on the many corpses of the fallen. A warrior is shown surrounded by piles of the fallen.

Characters viewing the carving may learn more:

- **DC 10 Intelligence (History)**: Forty years ago, Valentin defeated the orcs of the Severed Hand and the goblins of the Blood Moon. He also exterminated the Ebon Scales kobolds.
- **DC 15 Intelligence (History)**: The orcs are from the Severed Hand tribe, while the goblins hail from the Blood Moon tribe. The scene probably depicts one of his famous victories, possibly the Battle of Slaughter Meadow, wherein he broke the tribes' strength and slew the Severed Hand's chief (and many of his bodyguards) in single combat.

#### U3: WARRIOR' S CHAPEL

This large chamber was the keep's chapel. It is unoccupied.

*Two statues of warriors clad in plate and wielding a battleaxe flank a stone altar at the far end of this chamber. A small rotting ironbound coffer stands on the altar. Grey sludge covers much of the floor, and thick clumps of black mould grows on the walls.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Air Temperature**: It is cold within the chapel.

**Grey Sludge**: A thick layer of grey sludge covers much of the floor. A DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals nothing has recently moved through the sludge. A character using the Dash action must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or stop moving in the first sludge-filled square they enter. A character failing this check by 5 or more falls prone.

**Black Mould**: Several patches of black mould grow around the warrior statues. A DC 15 Wisdom (Nature) check reveals that the mould is natural and harmless.

**Warrior Statues**: Each intricately carved statue stands 10 ft. tall and depicts a warrior of severe mien clad in plate armour and holding a battleaxe grounded at their feet. A statue can be scaled with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

**Altar**: This plain stone altar stands 4 ft. high.

**Rotting Coffer**: This small, rotting, unlocked, iron-bound coffer contains items of religious significance. Much of the contents—including a copy of *Art of the Fighting-Master* and so on —have rotted away, leaving the chest half-full of sludge; a few treasures remain, however:

- A gold idol of a warrior wielding a battleaxe (worth 30 gp).
- A set of silver chimes (worth 10 gp) that produce a harsh, discordant sound when struck.
- A small wrought iron tripod (worth 10 gp) holding a sludgefilled iron bowl. The sludge hides three matched small opaque dark green gems (malachites, each worth 15 gp).

#### U4: COLUMNED HALLWAY

This columned hallway suffered some damage when the earthquake struck 20 years ago.

**Denizens**: Two **animate statues**, indistinguishable from the other statues holding aloft the ceiling, protect this area. They animate and attack when the first intruder reaches the mid-way point of the hallway. They focus on the intruders furthest along the <span id="page-118-0"></span>hallway. The statues pursue intruders as far as U1 but do not cross the pit.

*Slender pillars—carved to represent human warriors clad in plate armour and holding a battleaxe grounded in front of them—hold aloft this chill hallway's sagging ceiling.* 

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Air Temperature**: It is barely above freezing here.

**Ceiling**: The cracked and sagging ceiling is 12 ft. high. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the ceiling is unsafe. A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the destruction of two pillars will cause a cave-in.

**Warrior Columns**: The damaged columns (AC 14, hp 27, damage threshold 8, immune to poison and psychic damage, DC 15 Strength check breaks) hold the ceiling aloft. The columns provide half cover and can be scaled with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Destroying one or more of the inanimate columns causes the ceiling to collapse. Refer to "Collapsing Ceiling" for more details.

#### COLLAPSING CEILING

The characters may deliberately (or accidentally) cause the ceiling in U4 to collapse. Use these notes to adjudicate the subsequent events.

- **First Round**: In the round after a column falls, the ceiling in adjacent squares noticeably sags; dust and small rocks fall. The animate statues do not understand the danger and make no special actions to avoid the effect.
- **Second Round**: The ceiling collapses in a 10-foot radius around the collapsed pillars. Any character under the collapsing part of the ceiling must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 4d10 bludgeoning damage or half as much damage on a successful save. Once the ceiling has collapsed, rubble, which counts as difficult terrain, covers the floor below the collapsed section.
- **Subsequent Rounds**: The area of collapsing ceiling expands in a 5-foot radius every subsequent round until the entire hallway's ceiling has collapsed.

# U5: TH E CRYPT

Here, Valentin Ironwolf interred his slain followers in honour and state amid the remains of those they vanquished in battle. Sadly, the corruption emanating from the Chasm of Ebon Depths (U6) has animated some of the remains as fell undead creatures.

**Denizens**: As soon as a living creature enters the chamber, the skull chains animate; the clacking of their jaws alerts the four **gravechill skeletons** to intruders. The skeletons rise and move to attack in the next round. They fight until destroyed.

*It is freezing here. Chains, a skull hanging from each one, hang from the ceiling of this large chamber. In the centre of the room, a silver aspergillum hangs from a stout chain.* 

Rusted iron bars running from floor to ceiling divide this chamber into a number of distinct sections. Within each section, a jumble of bones covers the floor.

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Ceiling**: The ceiling is 20 ft. high.

**Air Temperature**: It is barely above freezing within the crypt. **Skull Chains**: Frost-rimmed chains (AC 19, hp 10; DC 20 Strength check bursts) hang from the ceiling to about four feet above the floor. A grinning goblin or orc skull (AC 15, hp 5) hangs from each one. The skulls animate, gnashing their teeth, when a living creature enters the chamber.

- **Movement (Medium or Larger Creatures)**: Medium or larger characters can avoid the animated skulls by moving slowly and carefully through the room. (It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square in such a manner .) Alternatively, a character can ignore the skulls and move at normal speed. Every round a character does so, they take two piercing damage as the skulls bite at the living creature moving through their squares.
- **Movement (Small or Smaller Creatures)**: Small or smaller characters move normally under the skulls and do not take damage from the skulls.

**Bone Piles**: Squares containing piles of bones count as difficult terrain (it costs 2 squares of movement to enter such a square).

**Chained Silver Battle Aspergillum**: A silver aspergillum filled with holy water hangs from a chain in the chamber's centre.

• **Silver Battle Aspergillum (25 gp)**: This simple one-handed melee weapon deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. A character can fill a battle aspergillum with holy water by using an action. A fiend or an undead struck by a battle aspergillum filled with holy water suffers 1d6 radiant damage and the weapon's normal bludgeoning damage. After two hits, the aspergillum must be refilled.

**Stone Columns**: Thick stone columns hold the roof aloft.

**Iron Bars**: Rusted iron bars (AC 19, damage threshold 8, hp 22, DC 20 Strength check bends) divide the room into sections. The iron bars provide half cover.

**Treasure**: Some of the glorious dead were interred with items of sentimental or actual value. A character making a Wisdom (Perception) check may uncover one or more items as they search the crypt:

- **DC 10**: A rotted grave shift embroidered with electrum braiding. The bright yellow braiding is in good condition (and worth 20 gp), but the shift is valueless.
- **DC 15**: A pair of golden earrings shaped like intricate flowers (worth 150 gp).
- **DC 20**: This steel potion vial has a wavy blue pattern etched into its neck. It contains a cloudy green liquid—a *potion of water breathing*.

# <span id="page-119-0"></span>U6: CHASM O F EBON DEPTHS

A connection to the Chasm of Ebon Depths formed when an earthquake struck the area and dumped a section of the Undercrypt into the chasm below.

**Denizen**: The characters may encounter one or more **shadows** here. (See "Necrotic Corruption" for more information).

*The still, black water filling this chasm glimmers sinisterly in the light. Water drips down from above, filling the cavern with the sound of rain. An aura of malign cold hangs in the air.* 

The flooded chasm likely blocks further exploration but could serve as the route to future adventures. (See "Further Adventures" for more details .)

#### NOTABLE FEATURES

**Temperature**: The water in the chasm is only a few degrees above freezing, and the air above the chasm is no warmer. A character without cold resistance, thick and warming clothing, or the like must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw after one hour in the chasm's proximity (and every hour thereafter). Characters failing their saving throw gain one additional level of exhaustion.

**Depth**: The water-filled chasm is 120 ft. deep.

**Chasm Walls**: The chasm walls are of natural stone and contain many niches and several entrances to small, inundated cavern systems. Characters can climb the cavern walls with DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks.

**Black Water**: Calm, black water (DC 10 Strength [Athletics] check to swim) fills the bottom 60 ft. of the chasm. Additionally:

- **Vision**: The black water obscures vision as the *darkness* spell.
- **Evil Aura**: *Detect evil* a*nd good* reveals an aura of desecration emanating from the water.
- **Water Temperature**: The water is virtually freezing. Characters in the water must make a Constitution saving throw as detailed in "Temperature" every ten minutes.

#### NECROTIC CORRUPTION

The flooded chasm is the source of the necrotic corruption warping the remains of the heroic dead interred in U5. The corruption's cause is up to you, but some examples of the corruption's vile source include:

- The barrier between the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane is weak around the chasm. This weakness allows necrotic energy to seep into the world. A small colony of six **shadows** has also slipped through into the cave. They lurk in the cracked chasm walls. Occasionally, they enter the cavern and immediately attack any living creature they encounter.
- Ancient, terrible things slither and ooze in the Ebon Realm. Although the Ebon Chasm is but 120 ft. deep, cracks and fissures in the rock descend far deeper into places where light and surface dwellers have never ventured. Eventually, these caverns intersect with the frozen lair of a mighty shoggoth. The shoggoth (fortunately) does not know of the connection between its realm and the Ebon Chasm, but certain of its unspeakable, alien activities are propagating the chill of its lair upwards.

Some characters—particularly those strong in the cause of good and law—may desire to remove this foul necrotic taint from the dungeons under the Shadowed Keep (particularly if they plan to claim the keep as their own). Such a quest could become the focus of an entire subterranean campaign! Refer to "Further Information" for more suggestions about how to continue play.

![](_page_119_Picture_18.jpeg)

# <span id="page-120-0"></span>FURTHER ADVENTURES

The Shadowed Keep can fade from your campaign—an adventure site cleansed and forgotten—or it can feature in future adventures.

#### CAVERNS DEEP

There are deep caverns below the keep, unknown (until now) by surface dwellers. If the characters discover their hidden entrances (locations M6 and W2) they could begin an epic quest to explore the lightless realms below. Alternatively, an invasion of deep dwellers could boil forth from the eternal dark. If the characters have claimed the keep as their own, they must end this threat or lose their home.

#### CHASM O F EBON DEPTHS

This water-filled fissure (location U6) offers further adventures beyond this adventure's scope. However, the characters likely require magic to make appreciable progress therein. If you decide to stock the chasm and the caverns radiating out from it first decide what is causing the corruption seeping upwards from below (see "Necrotic Corruption" [location U6]).

Alternatively, if the characters lack water-breathing magic and you want to include the area in your campaign, a minor earthquake or rock fall could open up a new passageway that slowly drains the chasm. As the water level gradually drops, the party gains access to new caves and new adventures!

# CLAIMING THE KEEP

Once the keep is empty, the characters could claim it as their own. In this way, the keep can become the focus of an entire campaign as the characters battle to clear the surrounding woodlands of enemies while repairing the shattered fortress. The obstacles to successfully completing such a task are legion.

Of course, the remaining denizens of the woods do their utmost to stymie such efforts. If any serious attempt at rebuilding is to be undertaken, the characters must first make the area safe for the many workers they must employ. They must also protect the routes by which men and material flow to the fortress.

Wido Gall, other local rulers or even Duke Armas Nenonen himself may take exception to the characters' power grab or see them as a nascent threat best nipped in the bud.

Over all this hangs the spectre of money (or lack thereof). The characters cannot rebuild their new home if they do not have the necessary funds. Thus, they must continue adventuring, find a rich patron or devise other inventive schemes to meet the high costs of rebuilding, completing and garrisoning their home.

Once the keep is firmly under their command, they have a base from which they can extend their control over the surrounding woodlands. (The sudden appearance at this time of a relative of Valentin Ironwolf, who demands the character return the castle to its rightful owner, could create interesting role-playing opportunities.)

#### HOLDING A GRUDGE

It is unlikely that the characters wipe out the goblins and bandits. Survivors could hold a grudge and return later in the campaign to exact their revenge. Such folk could be nothing more than a minor irritant or could have gained power consummate to the party's.

#### VONGYTH

In two places (locations W7 and M13), the characters may find maps (Player's Handout 3 and 4, respectively) regarding the fallen dwarven hold of Vongyth. They may choose to seek out the dwarves' fallen home.

Refer to "Vongyth" (page 32) to learn more about Vongyth.

#### WA R

The keep could be occupied in the future by bandits or by a force —perhaps a large migrating tribe of orcs or the like—that menaces the whole duchy. As the characters know the area and keep, they are called upon to end the threat. If this second threat emerges when the characters are relatively powerful and famous, they may subsequently be given the right to rebuild the keep by Wido Gall or Duke Nenonen in return for their support and loyalty. This could open a new chapter in the campaign wherein the characters must deal with and navigate the machinations of Ashlar's nobles.

| APPENDICES & PLAYER HANDOUTS |  |  |
|------------------------------|--|--|
|                              |  |  |

# <span id="page-123-0"></span>APPENDIX 1: DENIZENS O F DULWICH

This appendix presents the additional stat blocks you need to run encounters in Dulwich. The stat blocks appear in alphabetic order.

#### BRAALITES

Foul worshippers of the Dweller in Shadows stoop to any hateful depravity to venerate their loathsome patron. Such folk are wellversed at hiding among Ashlar's common folk. Careful cults can remain undetected for decades while more bloodthirsty groups inevitably reveal themselves (with predictable results).

**Braalite Cultist**: The cult's rank-and-file kidnap sacrificial victims, attend dark rituals and so on. Most are easily led, selfentered folk; all dream of advancement in the cult's ranks.

**Braalite Fanatic**: Such is the depth of a fanatic's depravity they have been granted a small measure of power by their shadowy patron. They assist the priest in running the cult, all the while scheming to increase their own standing and power.

**Braalite Priest**: The priest wields supreme authority over their minions. Ostensibly, their position is secure, but many are wildly paranoid and obsessed with power and their own survival.

# BRAAL

NE lesser god of hate, malice and revenge

**Epithets**: The Hated, Dweller in Shadows

**Symbol**: A cloven skull **Domains**: Death, Trickery **Favoured Weapon**: Morningstar

**Raiment**: Braal's adherents wear cowled black cloaks smeared with their sacrifices' blood and often shave their heads.

**Worshippers**: Braal whispers dark promises to the disposed, the bullied and those who desire power over their compatriots. Goblins and half-goblins also worship Braal, although he disdains such odious worshippers.

**Teachings**: Strike from the shadows; punish those who have wronged you and show no mercy. Take what you want and destroy that which you cannot take.

**Holy Texts**: The worship of Braal is not as prescriptive as other religions. No universally agreed upon text exists, but several dark tomes are preferred by various sects.

**Additional Notes**: Braal is the dark to Darlen's light. The struggle between the two is ancient and unending, and great enmity exists between their worshippers. For all his plotting and evil doings, however, Braal is nothing compared to the elder power of certain ancient, primal demons.

**Temples & Shrines**: Braal's temples are dark, hidden places concealed far from the prying eyes of non-believers. Normally his worshippers organise themselves into cults that confine themselves to a small geographical area. His followers are always secretive types, well versed in hiding in plain sight.

*Incorporeal Movement.* Aila can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if he ends his turn inside an object.

#### **ACTIONS**

*Withering Touch*. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., target. *Hit*: 11 (3d6+1) necrotic damage.

*Etherealness*. Aila enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane or vice versa. She is visible on the Material Plane while she is in the Border Ethereal and vice versa yet she can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

*Horrifying Visage.* Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. of Aila that can see her must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself with a successful save. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to Aila's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The ageing effect can be reversed with a *greater restoration* spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

*Possession (Recharge 5-6).* One humanoid that Aila can see within 5 feet of her must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by her; Aila then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. Aila now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. Aila can't be targeted by any attack or spell, except ones that turn undead, and she retains her alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma and immunity to being charmed and frightened. She otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Aila ends it as a bonus action, or she is turned or forced out by an effect like the *dispel evil and good* spell. When the possession ends, Aila reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to Aila's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

#### E: TOMB O F THE STONE WOMAN

Deadly traps and a terrible animated guardian lurk in the Tomb of the Stone Woman.

#### COLLAPSING CEILING TRAP

Twinned with the Poison Gas Trap detailed below, this trap waits to trap and slay the unwary.

#### **C OLLAPSING CEILING**

**Triggering the Trap**: This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of unstable ceiling in place.

**Spotting the Trap**: The trip wire (DC 15 Wisdom [Perception] spots) is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams.

**Disabling the Trap**: A DC 15 Dexterity check made by someone using thieves' tools disarms the trap. On a failed check, the trap triggers.

**Effect**: The ceiling collapses filling the two squares behind the capstone with rubble. Creatures in the area take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and are buried in the rubble (DC 15 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage and negates the buried result. Characters making a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw may elect to dive out of the tomb (but still take damage). Once the trap is triggered, the entrance to the tomb is blocked.

- **Buried Characters**: A conscious character buried in the rubble must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. Unconscious characters buried in the rubble must make a death-saving throw every round.
- **Freeing Buried Characters (or Escaping the Tomb)**: Freeing a character from the rubble requires a DC 20 Strength check. With a DC 23 Strength check a character clears the rubble in one round. It takes 2d10 minutes to clear the rubble from the entrance.

#### DART SWARM TRAP

Activated when the stone wizard steps down from its plinth, this trap fires darts until it runs out of ammunition.

**Triggering the Trap**: The dart swarm trap activates when the stone wizard steps down from the plinth.

**Spotting the Trap**: Twenty small holes ring the stone plinth (DC 11 Wisdom [Perception] spots). Checks made to find the holes once the trap has activated have advantage.

**Disabling the Trap**: A pressure plate system prohibits the trap from activating while a weight of 200 lb. or more, such as the stone wizard or a heavily armoured character, is on the plinth. A character can plug the gaps with a DC 11 Dexterity check, but this takes five minutes of work.

**Effect**: Once the trap activates, it fires darts into the room. Every round, the trap targets 1d3 living creatures in location E5; each takes 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage (a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw negates the damage). The trap continues firing until it has shot 20 darts.

#### POISON GA S TRAP

Twinned with the Collapsing Ceiling Trap detailed above, this trap waits to trap and slay the unwary.

#### **P OISON GA S**

**Triggering the Trap**: One minute after the ceiling collapses, a pale yellowy mist (insanity gas) starts to seep into the corridor through the tiny holes in the walls.

**Spotting the Trap**: A character making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the tiny holes in the walls.

**Disabling the Trap**: The tiny holes in the walls can be plugged with a DC 13 Dexterity check.

**Effect**: There is enough insanity gas to fill locations E2 and E3. It takes five rounds for the trap to fill the areas. For the subsequent five rounds all characters in these areas reduce their Wisdom by 1d3 (DC 13 Constitution saving throw negates). This reduction lasts until the character takes a long rest.

#### STONE WIZARD

The stone wizard slays all who dare invade the tomb.

#### DREAD SHRINE O F THE SUPREME WARLORD

#### CHARNEL GUARDIAN

*This dull grey stone statue depicts a double-headed battleaxe.* 

Charnel guardians are "living" statues. Priests of evil religions use these foul creations as protectors for their fallen shrines. They appear at first glance to be merely carven statues. Some charnel guardians look like skeletons or other forms of undead, and characters may suspect they are undead, but they are unaffected by such abilities as Turn Undead and the like.

**Combat Tactics**: A charnel guardian batters its foes until they are slain. It does not leave the area it protects.

**Constructed Nature**: A charnel guardian doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.

The magic that animates a charnel guardian is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. A charnel guardian reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and collapses—perhaps falling apart; at this point, it is too damaged to be of any further use either as a guardian or a decoration.

#### **ACTIONS**

*Multiattack*. The charnel guardian makes two melee attacks.

*Slam*. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage.

*Terrifying Gaze*. The charnel guardian targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the charnel guardian, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically frightened until the end of the charnel guardian's next turn. The frightened target is paralysed.

#### GUARDIAN AX E

*This rusty battleaxe flies through the air under its own volition.* 

Mindless guardians of the shrine, the guardian axes attack anyone profaning its precincts. A guardian axe attacks the nearest foe.

**Combat Tactics**: A guardian axe hacks at its foes until they are destroyed. It does not leave the area it protects.

**Constructed Nature**: A guardian axe doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.

The magic that animates a guardian axe is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. A guardian axe reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and falls to the ground—perhaps sundered or irrevocably bent; at this point, it is too damaged to be of any further use either as a guardian or a decoration.

#### ZOMBIE HOBGOBLIN WARRIOR

*Swathed from head to toe in greying, mouldering funeral bandages worn under rusty chain armour, this human-sized humanoid clutches a battleaxe. Its red eyes gleam balefully.* 

Centuries ago, a hobgoblin priest experimented with mummification to preserve the best qualities of a warrior after death. However, he failed, and all he created were zombies that looked like mummies but which had a few of a mummy's special features and qualities. For example, the hobgoblin zombie can talk (after a fashion) and retains more intelligence than a normal zombie. Sadly, however, the zombie is also vulnerable to fire.

*Withering Touch*. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., target. *Hit*: 11 (3d6+1) necrotic damage.

*Etherealness*. Einar enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane or vice versa. He is visible on the Material Plane while he is in the Border Ethereal and vice versa yet he can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

*Horrifying Visage.* Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. of Einar that can see him must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself with a successful save. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to Einar's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The ageing effect can be reversed with a *greater restoration* spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

*Possession (Recharge 5-6).* One humanoid that Einar can see within 5 feet of him must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by him; Einar then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. Einar now controls the body but doesn't

deprive the target of awareness. Einar can't be targeted by any attack or spell, except ones that turn undead, and he retains his alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma and immunity to being charmed

and frightened. He otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Einar ends it as a bonus action, or he is turned or forced out by an effect like the *dispel evil* 

*and good* spell. When the possession ends, Einar reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to Einar's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

Also known as the Death Worm, necrophidius are created to be assassins or guards. Although they appear to be undead—having the skeleton of a giant snake and a fanged human skull—they are actually constructs.

# <span id="page-136-0"></span>APPENDIX 4: WATCHTOWER DENIZENS

This appendix presents all the stat blocks required to run the Watchtower of the Bandit Queen portion of this adventure. The stat blocks appear in alphabetic order.

#### BARELI

*Clad in filthy hide armour, this fat and slovenly black-haired halforc woman has tiny pig-like eyes.* 

**Background**: Bareli is a deserter from the garrison at Dulwich Keep. She is also a murderer who slew her sergeant when he threatened her with—in her mind—an unfair punishment for sleeping through her guard duty.

**Personality**: Bareli is a thoroughly self-centred woman wholly obsessed with her own aggrandisement. She dreams of a life of easy luxury and of having many servants to carry out her will. The only problem is she can't be bothered to earn that lifestyle.

**Mannerisms**: Bareli spits great gobs of phlegm—sometimes into the food she cooks. She has no sense of personal hygiene and smells of stale food and sweat.

*Handaxe*. *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage.

**Wanted Bandit**: Returning Bareli to Dulwich Keep to face justice or presenting incontrovertible proof of her death earns the party 25 gp.

# BRIGAND

*Clad in dirty studded leather armour, this dishevelled human has a distinctly unsavoury look about them.* 

Blinded by Firean Maiethil's promise of wealth and comfort, these self-centred bandits and thieves gladly follow their mistress.

#### CULLEN ASIKKA

*Greasy black hair frames the face of a human male dominated by high cheekbones and acne.* 

**Background**: Unloved by his family, Cullen left home while still a child. Falling into the clutches of a smuggler gang, he was abused and exploited. An argument over loot left many of his fellows dead; with no ties (and none of the treasure), he fled and soon after fell in with Firean.

**Personality**: Unpredictable, violent and prone to brooding, Cullen has few friends. He respects Firean, but does not like her and thus does not have much loyalty to his fellows. He loves Fang. He is an inveterate hoarder and has squirrelled away a small cache of silver and gold. He does not willingly abandon it.

**Mannerisms**: Cullen talks to Fang as a parent to a child.

#### FIREAN MAIETHIL

*Muscular and attractive, this half-elf woman wears form-fitting leather armour and wields a morningstar. Her dark brown eyes regard you with a mixture of malevolence and boredom.* 

**Background**: A product of war, suffering and rape, Firean has wandered for many years, unable to find a place in the world.

**Personality**: Dedicated to Braal (NE lesser god of hate, malice and revenge), Firean dreams of establishing her own dominion from which she can war on her neighbours. The Shadowed Keep represents her chance to realise that dream. For her, might is right, and the weak are worthy of nothing but scorn.

**Mannerisms**: Firean cannot decide whether she wants her followers to love or fear her; consequently, she explains her decisions in great depth before threatening violence against any not sharing her perspective (or obeying her commands).

*Spellcasting*. Firean is a 4th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *light*, *sacred flame*, *thaumaturgy* 1st level (4 slots): *command*, *cure wounds*, *shield of faith* 2nd level (3 slots): *blindness*/*deafness*, *hold person*

# REITHIC YURGIRN

*Wide and heavily muscled, this dwarf has a thick black beard, glittering black eyes and thick, bushy eyebrows.* 

**Background**: A skilled warrior, Reithic is trying to carve out a career as a purveyor of fine dwarven weapons and armour. The bandits captured him during his first attempt at a trader's life.

**Personality**: Gruff and quick to anger, Reithic craves vengeance. He loudly asserts his desire to kill Yar.

**Mannerisms**: Reithic roars challenges in battle.

The statistics above assume Reithic has looted equipment from slain brigands. If he has not done so, modify his statistics thusly:

- **Armour Class** 11
- *Unarmed Strike*. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 4 bludgeoning damage.

**Reward**: Reithic happily (and enthusiastically) aids the characters in defeating the bandits but has no interest in exploring the rest of the ruin. He is grateful for his rescue, however, and 2d4 weeks after the party frees him, he seeks them out to gift them a *potion of greater healing*.

# YA R

*Clad in ragged, bloodstained clothes, this small, scrawny humanoid has a wide, ungainly head. Covered in sores and partially healed cuts and scrapes, it is a sorry sight.* 

**Background**: Captured several weeks ago, Yar has endured beatings and starvation during his incarceration.

**Personality**: Miserable and terrified, Yar is no longer a rapacious warrior of the Blood Moon. He has no desire to rejoin the tribe, preferring to flee the ruins if given the chance. His favourite battle tactic (preferably against helpless or oblivious foes) is "stabby stabby".

**Mannerisms**: Yar has developed a hacking cough during his incarceration and noticeably flinches when threatened.

#### **ACTIONS**

*Unarmed Strike*. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 1 bludgeoning damage.

**Hooks & Reward**: Yar just wants to live. In return for his freedom, he can describe the general layout of the donjon's cellars. Sadly, his artistic skills are terrible; any map he attempts is illegible. Particularly interesting facts he can divulge include:

- The tribe's indestructible ogre-chief, Ruknar, and his sadistic son, Razogen, dwell to the south.
- The tribe has two fearsome orc mercenaries.

Ruknar's concubines (Nig, Sbux and Zus) are vicious creatures obsessed with bearing Buknar's "blessed" seed. They see each other as competition and only cooperate when Ruknar commands it. They hiss and curse at their foes and exult when an enemy succumbs to their attacks. They don't make any particular effort to help each other in battle. Particularly large and nasty goblins, a concubine is in many ways the equal of a hobgoblin.

BLOOD MOON SNIPERS

*Covered in mud, this leather-clad goblin is filthy. It carries a small longbow, and a curved sword swings at its belt.*

**Mannerisms**: Razogen bellows and shouts in battle.

**Distinguishing Features**: Vestigial black horns grow from Razogen's forehead.

**Personality**: Violent, unpredictable and sadist, Razogen is perfectly suited to life in a goblin tribe.

**Background**: Razogen is the product of his father's mating with a goblin concubine. The concubine died in childbirth—so large a baby was Razogen. The first sound he heard was his mother's anguished screams.

#### RUKNAR

*This lumbering giant has small, beady eyes and a wide mouth filled with ill-fitting teeth. He wears mismatched pieces of chain armour and clutches an immense greatsword.* 

A foul, odious bully who delights in the pain, suffering, dismemberment and death of his foes, Ruknar is a terrible enemy.

**Mannerisms**: Ruknar spits and drools when excited. **Distinguishing Features**: Ruknar is immensely fat.

**Personality**: Ruknar enjoys his concubines' competition—even fostering it. He also enjoys dismembering and cooking his living enemies as a warning to those who plot against him.

**Background**: The taint of the Abyss lurks in Ruknar's past. As the only survivor of his original tribe, he easily wrested command of the Blood Moon from its previous chieftain two decades ago. Since then, he has lived the good life—plentiful women, loot and battle. He is content.

#### SA R, BLOOD MOON SHAMAN

*This bald and skinny humanoid wears dirty robes, and its head seems too large for its body.* 

Sar lusts to overthrow Ruknar and rule in his place. Although not a coward, Sar is not stupid and knows he is no match for the ogre. The characters' arrival presents him with a perfect opportunity to achieve his goal. Thus, he is keen to speak with the intruders.

**Distinguishing Features**: Impressively ugly, Sar stinks of blood, sweat and spell components.

**Mannerisms**: Sar has a hacking cough.

**Personality**: Obsessed with his own importance and consumed with a lust for power, Sar is self-obsessed to the point of mania. Totally immoral, he agrees to anything—no matter how shocking—to get his own way. He enjoys torture and has enjoyed time with the tribe's prisoners. He does not regret his actions.

**Background**: The favoured servant of the tribe's previous shaman, Sar gruesomely murdered his teacher several years ago.

#### JORMA LEMPIÄ

One of the brigands lairing in the watchtower above, Jorma thirsts for revenge upon his captors.

**Distinguishing Features**: Jorma's wide nose has been repeatedly broken.

**Mannerisms**: Jorma is perpetually scowling and appears to be in a bad temper. His speech is abrupt and aggressive.

**Personality**: Vicious, depraved and with an impressive capacity for violence, Jorma is foul-mouthed and inventive when it comes to torture.

**Background**: Jorma grew up in Dulwich, but was a troubled child from an early age. Sadistically beaten by his father, he grew into a terrible bully. Eventually, he murdered one of his peers and fled the town. Alone in the wilderness, it was not long before he fell in with bandits.

**Hooks**: Jorma promises to aid the party against the goblins; he gleefully slaughters goblins and keeps his word while the characters fight the Blood Moon tribe. As soon as the group leaves the keep, he begins plotting his escape. However, a sympathetic character (and good roleplaying) might bring about a change in Jorma (eventually shifting his alignment to true neutral).

#### UNTO TAPIO

Jorma's friend, Unto is a coward and desperate to escape.

**Distinguishing Features**: A deep scar runs down Unto's left cheek and neck.

**Mannerisms**: Unto agrees with practically everything he hears —he is obsequious in the extreme.

**Personality**: A snivelling coward, Unto is drawn to strength and becomes the shadow of the most dominant character. He loves animals—particularly cats.

**Background**: Born into a peasant family, he was forced to flee his village after a bout of prolonged thievery.

**Hooks**: Unto offers to aid the characters against the goblins but flees if things go badly. Shortly after release, he finds a pet rat and becomes devoted to its care.

#### KERKKO SALME

# GELATINOUS CUBE

*This quivering cube of slime contains bits of broken weapons and armour as well as many coins.* 

Silent, near-mindless and implacable killers, gelatinous cubes cruise the deep, lightless place of the world in search of food.

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

*Ooze Cube*. The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.

A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.

The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

*Transparent*. Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

#### **ACTIONS**

*Pseudopod*. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 10 (3d6) acid damage.

*Engulf*. The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creature's spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed back suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes, and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

# <span id="page-147-0"></span>P LAYER' S GUIDE T O DULWICH

**Ruler**: Wido Gall **Government**: Overlord

**Population**: 4,734 (4,634 humans, 15 dwarves, 3 elves, 11 half-

elves, 8 half-orcs, 63 halflings) **Alignments**: LG, NG, N, LN, LE, NE **Languages**: Common, Dwarven, Elven **Resources & Industry**: Lumber, pottery, wool

Dulwich stares out across the Salt Mire towards Hard Bay, the Forest of Gray Spires at its back. Just a few hundred years old, it rests on the remnants of numerous older structures built on a strip of dry land between the swamp and forest. One of the largest settlements in the Duchy of Ashlar, Dulwich serves as a major hub for merchants and travellers. A stout stone wall surrounds the main town, offering protection from the dangers lurking in the Salt Mire.

Wealth flows through the town in aplenty due to the lucrative timber industry and Dulwich's position as a trading centre. Its citizens live in well-constructed two-storey homes of stone (harvested from earlier settlements) and wood. While most of its streets remain hard-packed dirt, cobblestone paved roads appear in more affluent areas. A recently built keep lies at Dulwich's centre, built over an older wooden fortification. Its towers barely top the tall spire of the nearby Temple of Conn, a magnificent cathedral built with contributions from the town's affluent citizens.

Many of Dulwich's citizens are craftsmen, merchants or traders of some sort, with many more involved in logging. Guilds form the backbone of Dulwich, not just as a source of trade and income but also as a way of life. A few businesses cater to outsiders, particularly adventuresome types. To the west and south lies the ruins of Valentin's Folly, a small castle frequently sheltering wanted bandits (and—it is rumoured—much worse things). Within the forest, a day to the south lies the feared and legendary Shunned Valley, believed by the locals to be haunted. These are just two nearby attractions. The great and illimitable, doom-drenched halls of Gloamhold lie far to the north.

Dulwich still mourns the recent death of the former high priest of Conn, Taistro Rintala. His successor, the young priestess Vuokko Laiten, now heads the temple due to the support of influential merchants who seek to use her as a political pawn for power, particularly against Dulwich's ruler, Wido Gall. Wido relies on the Temple of Conn for public support. Wido was scheming with the high priest to wrest complete control of nearby Longbridge from his rival, Hilduin Lorsch, a plan now disrupted. Wido seeks to expand his power to stymie the growing power of the merchant class flush with gold from the profitable lumber industry.

# TOWNSFOLK

**Appearance**: Dulwichians are typically fair-skinned with brown or sandy-coloured hair and blue, hazel or brown eyes. Men prefer long moustaches without beards, while women wear long hair in buns or piled up with elaborate tresses and pins for the wealthy.

**Dress**: Fine-spun woollen tunics and breeches for the working class are the norm, dyed in the colours of the various trades or guilds the Dulwichian is assorted with.

**Nomenclature**: *male* Einar, Jarmo, Pekka, Vesa; *female* Elena, Irja, Riita, Ulpo; *family* Eskola, Leino, Salonen, Takala.

#### TRADE & INDUSTRY

Dulwich is mostly known for its booming lumber industry, which employs many citizens and brings in great wealth. Though a significant source of income for the town, it is not Dulwich's only notable industry. Many citizens belong to the town's guilds, making everything from pottery to clothing, and members wear their guild's colours to denote their membership. The various guilds typically occupy entire streets. No craftsman may operate in a trade without joining the relevant guild.

#### TH E GUILDS

The Gall family rule Dulwich, as they have since the town was founded centuries ago. However, the merchant class are becoming increasingly influential in the town's day-to-day affairs, and a clandestine struggle is going on for power. Recently, this struggle has spilt out into the town's religious life, with both the guilds and Wido Gall attempting to secure the support of the new high priestess of Conn—Vuokko Laiten. Four guilds, the Blacksmiths', Potters', Lumber and Woolmans', dominate Dulwich's mercantile life.

#### LAW & ORDER

A well-equipped town guard imposes order in Dulwich, led by the respected captain, Tuula Tenbaran. Lawbreakers are imprisoned in the dungeons beneath Dulwich Keep. Because Wido Gall oversees all trials of note, many of the merchant class suffer stiffer fines and penalties, which compel them to scheme against their lord even further. The merchants, of course, would love to have Tuula Tenbaran in their pocket, but she remains stubbornly loyal to Wido.

#### TH E THIEVES

Unlike Ashlar's capital city, Languard, Dulwich does not have a single, dominant thieves' guild. Rather, a patchwork of minor gangs struggle incessantly among themselves for territory, standing and profit. Most such gangs number no more than a dozen individuals, and most of their members are not particularly skilled. Dulwich's two most notable gangs are the Shadow Spiders (the most powerful and violent of the gangs) and the Black Cats (who are popular with the common folk as they liberally share their ill-gotten gains).

#### NOTABLE LOCATIONS I N BRIEF

Most of Dulwich comprises peasant homes and businesses. A few locations, however, are of interest to adventurers:

- 1. **Dulwich Keep**: Seat of the Gall family, the squat Dulwich Keep lies at the heart of Wido Gall's machinations. The town guard is based here, and the dungeons below the keep house lawbreakers and those who fall foul of Wido.
  - **Wido Gall** (male human wizard) rules Dulwich. He seeks to extend his influence to the nearby village of Longbridge, at the expense of his rivals.
  - **Tuula Tenhunen** (female half-orc warrior) leads the town guard and is fiercely loyal to Wido Gall. She is nicknamed the "Iron Maiden" due to the mask she always wears.
- 2. **The Lawgiver's Hall**: The lofty spire of this elaborate cathedral dominates Dulwich's skyline.
  - **Vuokko Laiten** (female human cleric of Conn) serves as Conn's high priestess in Dulwich. She is young for the role, and some see her as unsuitable. Both Wido Gall and the merchants vie for her favour.
- 3. **Lumberyard and Guild Hall**: The lumber guild is wealthy and influential; their holdings reflect their status.
  - **Ossi Karppanen** (male human) leads the lumber guild and seeks to instate a ruling council of merchants. He is one of Dulwich's richest citizens and consequently has much power and influence.
- 4. **The Dancing Bear**: Run by the former half-elven adventurer Nurlon Rekinen, this is a popular drinking establishment for adventurers and off-duty guardsmen.
  - **Nurlon Rekunen** (middle-aged male half-elf warrior) runs the Dancing Bear, which caters to adventurers and travellers. He is a former adventurer and Nalthra's twin.
- 5. **Nalthra's Jewellery**: Nalthra is Dulwich's most renowned jeweller. She might not offer the best price for gems and jewellery, but she can handle large deals.
  - **Nalhra Rekunen** (middle-aged female half-elf) frequently seeks precious gems to work into pieces of art but is renowned for not offering good prices. Nalthra is a renowned jeweller.
- 6. **The East Gate**: This sprawling inn is popular with Dulwich's wealthy.
  - **Hannu Mieho** (old male human) owns the inn and loves rubbing shoulders with his rich and powerful customers. He does little actual work these days.
- 7. **The Golden Skull**: This dingy, forgettable watering hole has a fighting pit and gambling hall beneath the tavern.
  - **Voitto Markku** (male human) owns the tavern and has the look of one who does not often see the sun.

- 8. **Eronen's Safe Travels**: The retired, one-armed adventurer Henni Eronen runs this large, well-stocked general store.
  - **Henni Eronen** (female human warrior) is extremely knowledgeable about the town's surrounds.
- 9. **Saini Alanen's House**: Home to Dulwich's most renowned sage, the ground floor also serves as a public library. Saini is available for private research projects.
  - **Saini Alanen** (female human) oversees a small, independent library where she researches the local area and assists in political matters.
- 10. **Cemetery and Catacombs**: Recently, rumours of strange goings-on have begun to cluster about these catacombs and mausoleums.
- 11. **Dulwich Marketplace**: This bustling daily market hosts numerous stalls and booths. Street performers are rife here, as are wandering merchants and pickpockets.
  - **Zado** (male human) works in the marketplace as a street performer or, perhaps, street performers.
- 12. **Dulwich Poorhouse**: Here dwell those who have nowhere else to go. It is a hard, bleak place.
  - **Chancellor Aadam Ehtaro** (middle-aged male human) presides here and oversees the daily hire.
- 13. **Vilimzair's Arms**: Named for the near-mythical bard and legendary pirate captain Vilimzair Aralivar, this tavern offers cheap, plentiful drink and bawdy, joyful entertainment.
  - **Sofia Ehtaro** (middle-aged female half-elf warrior) can't sing, can't play any instruments and can't act. Nevertheless, this charismatic woman loves entertaining people
- 14. **The Crooked House**: This general store offers a vast variety of things for sale.
  - **Kerttuli Ilmarinen** (female human) runs the Crooked House.
- 15. **Badger's**: Guarded by loyal mercenaries, this crenellated manor is a bank, moneychangers and home.
  - **Bernhard "Badger" Ilmatoivia** (middle-aged male human warrior) has a reputation as a man of character. He is an ex-adventurer and is rumoured to be fabulously wealthy.
- 16. **The Three Bells**: This inn is popular with pilgrims visiting Lawgiver's Hall.
  - **Valto Ilakka** (middle-aged male human) runs the Three Bells as his family has done for generations.
